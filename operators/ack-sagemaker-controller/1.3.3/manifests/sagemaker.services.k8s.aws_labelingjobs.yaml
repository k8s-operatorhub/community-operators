                      takes in your initial testing, the more you should offer.

                  If you are creating an adjustment or verification labeling job, you must
                  use a different LabelAttributeName than the one used in the original labeling
                  job. The original labeling job is the Ground Truth labeling job that produced
                  the labels that you want verified or adjusted. To learn more about adjustment
                  and verification labeling jobs, see Verify and Adjust Labels (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-verification-data.html).

                  For 3D point cloud and video frame task types, you can add label category
                  attributes and frame attributes to your label category configuration file.
                  To learn how, see Create a Labeling Category Configuration File for 3D Point
                  Cloud Labeling Jobs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-label-category-config.html).

                  For named entity recognition jobs, in addition to "labels", you must provide
                  worker instructions in the label category configuration file using the "instructions"
                  parameter: "instructions": {"shortInstruction":"
                  Add header

                  Add Instructions

                  Add additional instructions.

                  Job (API) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-named-entity-recg.html#sms-creating-ner-api).

                  For all other built-in task types (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-task-types.html)
                  and custom tasks (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-custom-templates.html),
                  your label category configuration file must be a JSON file in the following
                  format. Identify the labels you want to use by replacing label_1, label_2,...,label_n
                  with your label categories.

                  {

                  "document-version": "2018-11-28",

                  }

                  Note the following about the label category configuration file:

                     * For image classification and text classification (single and multi-label)
                     you must specify at least two label categories. For all other task types,
                     the minimum number of label categories required is one.

                     * Each label category must be unique, you cannot specify duplicate label
                     categories.

                     * If you create a 3D point cloud or video frame adjustment or verification
                     labeling job, you must include auditLabelAttributeName in the label category
                     configuration. Use this parameter to enter the LabelAttributeName (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLabelingJob.html#sagemaker-CreateLabelingJob-request-LabelAttributeName)
                     of the labeling job you want to adjust or verify annotations of.
