                  among the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality
                  can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas
                  in your DB cluster. \n If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica
                  that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance,
                  your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload
                  to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect
                  to the reader endpoint."
