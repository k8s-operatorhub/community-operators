                  CustomKeyStoreID and ConnectionState use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

                  This parameter is valid only for symmetric encryption KMS keys in a single
                  Region. You cannot create any other type of KMS key in a custom key store.

                  When you create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store, KMS generates a non-exportable
                  256-bit symmetric key in its associated CloudHSM cluster and associates it
                  with the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in an external key store, you
                  must use the XksKeyId parameter to specify an external key that serves as
                  key material for the KMS key.

                  Specifies the type of KMS key to create. The default value, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT,
                  creates a KMS key with a 256-bit AES-GCM key that is used for encryption
                  and decryption, except in China Regions, where it creates a 128-bit symmetric
                  key that uses SM4 encryption. For help choosing a key spec for your KMS key,
                  see Choosing a KMS key type (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-types.html#symm-asymm-choose)
                  in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

                  The KeySpec determines whether the KMS key contains a symmetric key or an
                  asymmetric key pair. It also determines the algorithms that the KMS key supports.
                  You can't change the KeySpec after the KMS key is created. To further restrict
                  the algorithms that can be used with the KMS key, use a condition key in
                  its key policy or IAM policy. For more information, see kms:EncryptionAlgorithm
                  (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-encryption-algorithm),

                  Amazon Web Services services that are integrated with KMS (http://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration)
                  use symmetric encryption KMS keys to protect your data. These services do
                  not support asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys.

                  KMS supports the following key specs for KMS keys:

                     * Symmetric encryption key (default) SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT

                     * HMAC keys (symmetric) HMAC_224 HMAC_256 HMAC_384 HMAC_512

                     * Asymmetric RSA key pairs (encryption and decryption -or- signing and
                     verification) RSA_2048 RSA_3072 RSA_4096

                     * Asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve key pairs (signing and verification
                     -or- deriving shared secrets) ECC_NIST_P256 (secp256r1) ECC_NIST_P384

                     * For symmetric encryption KMS keys, omit the parameter or specify ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.

                     * For HMAC KMS keys (symmetric), specify GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC.

                     * For asymmetric KMS keys with RSA key pairs, specify ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
                     or SIGN_VERIFY.

                     * For asymmetric KMS keys with NIST-recommended elliptic curve key pairs,

                  key.

                  For a multi-Region key, set this parameter to True. For a single-Region KMS
                  key, omit this parameter or set it to False. The default value is False.

                  This operation supports multi-Region keys, an KMS feature that lets you create
                  multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions.
                  Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata,
                  you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services
                  Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting
                  the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region

                  This value creates a primary key, not a replica. To create a replica key,
                  use the ReplicateKey operation.

                  You can create a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region key, and you can create
                  a multi-Region key with imported key material. However, you cannot create

                  in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. The EXTERNAL origin value
                  is valid only for symmetric KMS keys.

                  To create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-cmk-keystore.html)
                  and create its key material in the associated CloudHSM cluster, set this

                  If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:

                     * The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a subsequent
                     PutKeyPolicy request on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that the KMS
                     key becomes unmanageable. For more information, see Default key policy
                     (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-default.html#prevent-unmanageable-key)
                     in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. (To omit this condition,
                     set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true.)

                     * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals.
                     The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to KMS. When
                     you create a new Amazon Web Services principal, you might need to enforce
                     a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the
                     new principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more information,
                     see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency)
                     in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide.

                  If you do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches a default key policy to
                  the KMS key. For more information, see Default key policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default)
                  in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

                  The key policy size quota is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).

                  Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key.
                  For details, see ABAC for KMS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html)
                  in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

                  To use this parameter, you must have kms:TagResource (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html)
                  permission in an IAM policy.

                  Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the
                  tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null) string.
                  You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same tag key. If
                  you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value, KMS replaces
                  the current tag value with the specified one.

                  When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web Services
                  generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags.
                  Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For details, see Tagging
