                  The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint for a cluster load
                  balances connections across the Amazon DocumentDB replicas that are available
                  in a cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint,
                  Amazon DocumentDB distributes the connection requests among the Amazon DocumentDB
                  replicas in the cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload
                  across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in your cluster.


                  If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you are connected
                  to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To
                  continue sending your read workload to other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in
                  the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.
