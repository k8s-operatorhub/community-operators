                  - DestinationConfig
                  A destination for events after they have been sent to a function for processing.

                  Types of Destinations:
                  Function - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Lambda function.
                  Queue - The ARN of a standard SQS queue.
                  Topic - The ARN of a standard SNS topic.
                  Event Bus - The ARN of an Amazon EventBridge event bus.

                  - MaximumEventAgeInSeconds
                  The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing.

                  - MaximumRetryAttempts
                  The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error.
