                    Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                    To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the
                    Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore
                    feature name for the Name parameter.

                    You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance
                    when you call one of the following actions:

                       * CreateDBInstance

                       * ModifyDBInstance

                       * RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                       * RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                       * RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                    You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by
                    calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the
                    instance class for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                    In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor
                    information:

                       * DescribeDBInstances

                       * DescribeDBSnapshots

                       * DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                    If you call DescribeDBInstances, ProcessorFeature returns non-null values
                    only if the following conditions are met:

                       * You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                       * Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU
                       cores and threads per core.

                       * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.

                      ARN is the Amazon Resource Name for the resource. This is a
                      globally-unique identifier and is set only by the ACK service controller
                      once the controller has orchestrated the creation of the resource OR
                      when it has verified that an "adopted" resource (a resource where the
                      ARN annotation was set by the Kubernetes user on the CR) exists and
                      matches the supplied CR's Spec field values.

                        Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                        To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the
                        Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore
                        feature name for the Name parameter.

                        You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance
                        when you call one of the following actions:

                           * CreateDBInstance

                           * ModifyDBInstance

                           * RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                           * RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                           * RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                        You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by
                        calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the
                        instance class for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                        In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor
                        information:

                           * DescribeDBInstances

                           * DescribeDBSnapshots

                           * DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                        If you call DescribeDBInstances, ProcessorFeature returns non-null values
                        only if the following conditions are met:

                           * You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                           * Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU
                           cores and threads per core.

                           * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.
