                        Represents a step adjustment for a StepScalingPolicyConfiguration (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_StepScalingPolicyConfiguration.html).
                        Describes an adjustment based on the difference between the value of the
                        aggregated CloudWatch metric and the breach threshold that you've defined
                        for the alarm.

                        For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach
                        threshold of 50:

                           * To initiate the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal
                           to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound
                           of 10.

                           * To initiate the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less
                           than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of
                           0.

                        There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

                           * The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.

                           * At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step
                           adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment
                           with a null lower bound.

                           * At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step
                           adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment
                           with a null upper bound.

                           * The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.

                      For information about the available metrics for a service, see Amazon Web
                      Services services that publish CloudWatch metrics (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html)
                      in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

                      To create your customized metric specification:

                         * Add values for each required parameter from CloudWatch. You can use
                         an existing metric, or a new metric that you create. To use your own metric,
                         you must first publish the metric to CloudWatch. For more information,
                         see Publish custom metrics (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html)
                         in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

                         * Choose a metric that changes proportionally with capacity. The value
                         of the metric should increase or decrease in inverse proportion to the
                         number of capacity units. That is, the value of the metric should decrease
                         when capacity increases, and increase when capacity decreases.

                      matches the supplied CR's Spec field values.
