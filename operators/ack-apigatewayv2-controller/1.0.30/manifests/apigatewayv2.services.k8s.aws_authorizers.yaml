              authorizerURI:
                description: |-
                  The authorizer's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). For REQUEST authorizers,
                  this must be a well-formed Lambda function URI, for example, arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:{account_id}:function:{lambda_function_name}/invocations.
                  In general, the URI has this form: arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:lambda:path/{service_api}
                  , where {region} is the same as the region hosting the Lambda function, path
                  indicates that the remaining substring in the URI should be treated as the
                  path to the resource, including the initial /. For Lambda functions, this
                  is usually of the form /2015-03-31/functions/[FunctionARN]/invocations. Supported
                  only for REQUEST authorizers.
                type: string
              enableSimpleResponses:
                description: |-
                  Specifies whether a Lambda authorizer returns a response in a simple format.
                  By default, a Lambda authorizer must return an IAM policy. If enabled, the
                  Lambda authorizer can return a boolean value instead of an IAM policy. Supported
                  only for HTTP APIs. To learn more, see Working with AWS Lambda authorizers
                  for HTTP APIs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-lambda-authorizer.html)
                type: boolean
              identitySource:
                description: |-
                  The identity source for which authorization is requested.

                  For a REQUEST authorizer, this is optional. The value is a set of one or
                  more mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. The identity
                  source can be headers, query string parameters, stage variables, and context
                  parameters. For example, if an Auth header and a Name query string parameter
                  are defined as identity sources, this value is route.request.header.Auth,
                  route.request.querystring.Name for WebSocket APIs. For HTTP APIs, use selection
                  expressions prefixed with $, for example, $request.header.Auth, $request.querystring.Name.
                  These parameters are used to perform runtime validation for Lambda-based
                  authorizers by verifying all of the identity-related request parameters are
                  present in the request, not null, and non-empty. Only when this is true does
                  the authorizer invoke the authorizer Lambda function. Otherwise, it returns
                  a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. For HTTP
                  APIs, identity sources are also used as the cache key when caching is enabled.
                  To learn more, see Working with AWS Lambda authorizers for HTTP APIs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-lambda-authorizer.html).

                  For JWT, a single entry that specifies where to extract the JSON Web Token
                  (JWT) from inbound requests. Currently only header-based and query parameter-based
                  selections are supported, for example $request.header.Authorization.
