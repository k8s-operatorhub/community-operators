              RuleGroupSpec defines the desired state of RuleGroup.


              The object that defines the rules in a rule group. This, along with RuleGroupResponse,
              define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for a rule group by calling
              DescribeRuleGroup.


              Network Firewall uses a rule group to inspect and control network traffic.
              You define stateless rule groups to inspect individual packets and you define
              stateful rule groups to inspect packets in the context of their traffic flow.


              To use a rule group, you include it by reference in an Network Firewall firewall
              policy, then you use the policy in a firewall. You can reference a rule group
              from more than one firewall policy, and you can use a firewall policy in
              more than one firewall.

                  Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to analyze the stateless rules
                  in the rule group for rule behavior such as asymmetric routing. If set to
                  TRUE, Network Firewall runs the analysis and then creates the rule group
                  for you. To run the stateless rule group analyzer without creating the rule
                  group, set DryRun to TRUE.
                type: boolean
              capacity:
                description: |-
                  The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group
                  capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited
                  to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy,
                  Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule group.


                  You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group before
                  you create the rule group by calling CreateRuleGroup with DryRun set to TRUE.


                  You can't change or exceed this capacity when you update the rule group,
                  so leave room for your rule group to grow.


                  Capacity for a stateless rule group


                  For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity
                  requirements of the individual rules that you expect to have in the rule
                  group.


                  To calculate the capacity requirement of a single rule, multiply the capacity
                  requirement values of each of the rule's match settings:


                     * A match setting with no criteria specified has a value of 1.


                     * A match setting with Any specified has a value of 1.


                     * All other match settings have a value equal to the number of elements
                     provided in the setting. For example, a protocol setting ["UDP"] and a
                     source setting ["10.0.0.0/24"] each have a value of 1. A protocol setting
                     ["UDP","TCP"] has a value of 2. A source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"]
                     has a value of 3.


                  A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has a capacity
                  requirement of 1. A rule with protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"], source setting
                  ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"], and a single specification or
                  no specification for each of the other match settings has a capacity requirement
                  of 6.


                  Capacity for a stateful rule group


                  For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity required is the number of
                  individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group.

                  Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of
                  the request, rather than run the request.


                  If set to TRUE, Network Firewall checks whether the request can run successfully,
                  but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call returns the value
                  that the request would return if you ran it with dry run set to FALSE, but
                  doesn't make additions or changes to your resources. This option allows you
                  to make sure that you have the required permissions to run the request and
                  that your request parameters are valid.


                  If set to FALSE, Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your resources.

                            This is used in CreateRuleGroup or UpdateRuleGroup. An IP set reference is
                            a rule variable that references resources that you create and manage in another
                            Amazon Web Services service, such as an Amazon VPC prefix list. Network Firewall
                            IP set references enable you to dynamically update the contents of your rules.
                            When you create, update, or delete the resource you are referencing in your
                            rule, Network Firewall automatically updates the rule's content with the
                            changes. For more information about IP set references in Network Firewall,

                          For HTTPS traffic, domain filtering is SNI-based. It uses the server name
                          indicator extension of the TLS handshake.


                          By default, Network Firewall domain list inspection only includes traffic
                          coming from the VPC where you deploy the firewall. To inspect traffic from
                          IP addresses outside of the deployment VPC, you set the HOME_NET rule variable
                          to include the CIDR range of the deployment VPC plus the other CIDR ranges.

                                You can use custom actions in the following places:


                                   * In a rule group's StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The
                                   custom actions are available for use by name inside the StatelessRulesAndCustomActions
                                   where you define them. You can use them for your stateless rule actions
                                   to specify what to do with a packet that matches the rule's match attributes.


                                   * In a FirewallPolicy specification, in StatelessCustomActions. The custom
                                   actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them.
                                   You can use them for the policy's default stateless actions settings to
                                   specify what to do with packets that don't match any of the policy's stateless
                                   rules.

                                              is a name/value pair that's part of the identity of a metric.


                                              Network Firewall sets the dimension name to CustomAction and you provide
                                              the dimension value.

                        in your account and identifies the rules that might adversely effect your
                        firewall's functionality. For example, if Network Firewall detects a rule
                        that's routing traffic asymmetrically, which impacts the service's ability
                        to properly process traffic, the service includes the rule in a list of analysis

                  To make changes to the rule group, you provide the token in your request.
                  Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group hasn't changed
                  since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with
                  an InvalidTokenException. If this happens, retrieve the rule group again
                  to get a current copy of it with a current token. Reapply your changes as
                  needed, then try the operation again using the new token.
