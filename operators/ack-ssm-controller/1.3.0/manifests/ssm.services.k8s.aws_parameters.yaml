                  The data type for a String parameter. Supported data types include plain
                  text and Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs.

                  The following data type values are supported.

                     * text

                     * aws:ec2:image

                     * aws:ssm:integration

                  When you create a String parameter and specify aws:ec2:image, Amazon Web
                  Services Systems Manager validates the parameter value is in the required
                  format, such as ami-12345abcdeEXAMPLE, and that the specified AMI is available
                  in your Amazon Web Services account.

                  If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response
                  which indicates a successful PutParameter call for all cases except for data
                  type aws:ec2:image. If you call PutParameter with aws:ec2:image data type,
                  a successful HTTP 200 response does not guarantee that your parameter was
                  successfully created or updated. The aws:ec2:image value is validated asynchronously,
                  and the PutParameter call returns before the validation is complete. If you
                  submit an invalid AMI value, the PutParameter operation will return success,
                  but the asynchronous validation will fail and the parameter will not be created
                  or updated. To monitor whether your aws:ec2:image parameters are created
                  successfully, see Setting up notifications or trigger actions based on Parameter
                  Store events (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-cwe.html).

                  The fully qualified name includes the complete hierarchy of the parameter
                  path and name. For parameters in a hierarchy, you must include a leading

                  example: /Dev/DBServer/MySQL/db-string13

                  Naming Constraints:

                     * Parameter names are case sensitive.

                     * A parameter name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region

                     * A parameter name can't be prefixed with "aws" or "ssm" (case-insensitive).

                     * Parameter names can include only the following symbols and letters:
                     a-zA-Z0-9_.- In addition, the slash character ( / ) is used to delineate
                     hierarchies in parameter names. For example: /Dev/Production/East/Project-ABC/MyParameter

                     * A parameter name can't include spaces.

                     * Parameter hierarchies are limited to a maximum depth of fifteen levels.

                  One or more policies to apply to a parameter. This operation takes a JSON
                  array. Parameter Store, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
                  supports the following policy types:

                  Expiration: This policy deletes the parameter after it expires. When you
                  create the policy, you specify the expiration date. You can update the expiration
                  date and time by updating the policy. Updating the parameter doesn't affect
                  the expiration date and time. When the expiration time is reached, Parameter
                  Store deletes the parameter.

                  ExpirationNotification: This policy initiates an event in Amazon CloudWatch
                  Events that notifies you about the expiration. By using this policy, you
                  can receive notification before or after the expiration time is reached,
                  in units of days or hours.

                  NoChangeNotification: This policy initiates a CloudWatch Events event if
                  a parameter hasn't been modified for a specified period of time. This policy
                  type is useful when, for example, a secret needs to be changed within a period
                  of time, but it hasn't been changed.

                  All existing policies are preserved until you send new policies or an empty
                  policy. For more information about parameter policies, see Assigning parameter

              tier:

                  The parameter tier to assign to a parameter.

                  Parameter Store offers a standard tier and an advanced tier for parameters.
                  Standard parameters have a content size limit of 4 KB and can't be configured
                  to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 10,000 standard parameters
                  for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Standard parameters are
                  offered at no additional cost.

                  Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be configured
                  to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 100,000 advanced parameters
                  for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Advanced parameters incur
                  a charge. For more information, see Managing parameter tiers (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-advanced-parameters.html)
                  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.

                  You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any time. But
                  you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting
                  an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in data loss because
                  the system would truncate the size of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting
                  would also remove any policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced
                  parameters use a different form of encryption than standard parameters.

                  If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to
                  incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate
                  it as a new standard parameter.

                  Using the Default Tier Configuration

                  In PutParameter requests, you can specify the tier to create the parameter
                  in. Whenever you specify a tier in the request, Parameter Store creates or
                  updates the parameter according to that request. However, if you don't specify
                  a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current
                  Parameter Store default tier configuration.

                  The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the standard-parameter
                  tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can specify one of the
                  following as the default:

                     * Advanced: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all requests as
                     advanced parameters.

                     * Intelligent-Tiering: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates each
                     request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced. If the
                     request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter,
                     the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more
                     options requiring an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter
                     Store create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier. This approach
                     helps control your parameter-related costs by always creating standard
                     parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary.

                  Options that require an advanced parameter include the following:

                     * The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.

                     * The parameter uses a parameter policy.

                     * More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your Amazon Web Services
                     account in the current Amazon Web Services Region.

                  For more information about configuring the default tier option, see Specifying
                  a default parameter tier (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-advanced-parameters.html#ps-default-tier)

                  The new version number of a parameter. If you edit a parameter value, Parameter
                  Store automatically creates a new version and assigns this new version a
                  unique ID. You can reference a parameter version ID in API operations or
                  in Systems Manager documents (SSM documents). By default, if you don't specify
                  a specific version, the system returns the latest parameter value when a
                  parameter is called.
