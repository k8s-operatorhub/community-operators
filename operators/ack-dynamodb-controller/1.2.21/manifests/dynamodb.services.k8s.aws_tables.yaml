                     * IndexName - The name of the global secondary index. Must be unique only
                     for this table.

                     * Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from the
                     table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes
                     and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. Each attribute
                     specification is composed of: ProjectionType - One of the following: KEYS_ONLY

                     of one or more non-key attribute names that are projected into the secondary
                     index. The total count of attributes provided in NonKeyAttributes, summed

                          Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes
                          that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

                          A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For
                          example, a simple primary key would be represented by one KeySchemaElement
                          (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one KeySchemaElement
                          for the partition key, and another KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                          A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute).
                          The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot

                  The attributes in KeySchema must also be defined in the AttributeDefinitions
                  array. For more information, see Data Model (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DataModel.html)
                  in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

                  Each KeySchemaElement in the array is composed of:

                     * AttributeName - The name of this key attribute.

                     * KeyType - The role that the key attribute will assume: HASH - partition
                     key RANGE - sort key

                  The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute. The term
                  "hash attribute" derives from the DynamoDB usage of an internal hash function
                  to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition
                  key values.

                  The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term "range
                  attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition
                  key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                  For a simple primary key (partition key), you must provide exactly one element
                  with a KeyType of HASH.

                  For a composite primary key (partition key and sort key), you must provide
                  exactly two elements, in this order: The first element must have a KeyType
                  of HASH, and the second element must have a KeyType of RANGE.

                    Amazon Web Services-assigned tag names and values are automatically assigned

                    have the prefix user: in the Cost Allocation Report. You cannot backdate
                    the application of a tag.

                     * CREATING - The table is being created.

                     * UPDATING - The table/index configuration is being updated. The table/index
                     remains available for data operations when UPDATING.

                     * DELETING - The table is being deleted.

                     * ACTIVE - The table is ready for use.

                     * INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS - The KMS key used to encrypt the
                     table in inaccessible. Table operations may fail due to failure to use
                     the KMS key. DynamoDB will initiate the table archival process when a
                     table's KMS key remains inaccessible for more than seven days.

                     * ARCHIVING - The table is being archived. Operations are not allowed
                     until archival is complete.

                     * ARCHIVED - The table has been archived. See the ArchivalReason for more
                     information.
