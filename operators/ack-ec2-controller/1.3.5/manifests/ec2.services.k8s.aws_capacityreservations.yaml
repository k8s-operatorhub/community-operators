                  launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired
                  when it reaches its end date and time.

                  You must provide an EndDate value if EndDateType is limited. Omit EndDate
                  if EndDateType is unlimited.

                  If the EndDateType is limited, the Capacity Reservation is cancelled within
                  an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55,
                  the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55
                  on 5/31/2019.

                  If you are requesting a future-dated Capacity Reservation, you can't specify
                  an end date and time that is within the commitment duration.

                     * limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified
                     date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if the EndDateType value

                  (25 * m5.xlarge = 100 vCPUs).

                  The options include:

                     * open - The Capacity Reservation automatically matches all instances
                     that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability
                     Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run in the Capacity Reservation
                     automatically without specifying any additional parameters.

                     * targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have
                     matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone),
                     and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only
                     permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.

                  If you are requesting a future-dated Capacity Reservation, you must specify
