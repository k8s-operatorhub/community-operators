              RuleGroupSpec defines the desired state of RuleGroup.

              A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests
              that you can use in a WebACL. When you create a rule group, you define an
              immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within
              the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence
              in its capacity requirements.
            properties:
              capacity:
                description: |-
                  The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group.

                  When you create your own rule group, you define this, and you cannot change
                  it after creation. When you add or modify the rules in a rule group, WAF
                  enforces this limit. You can check the capacity for a set of rules using
                  CheckCapacity.

                  WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used
                  to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently
                  for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules
                  that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more
                  processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users
                  plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. For more information,
                  see WAF web ACL capacity units (WCU) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-waf-capacity-units.html)

                               Request Accepted. If the request contains an Accept header with a value

                               a challenge script. Challenges run silent browser interrogations in the
                               background, and don't generally affect the end user experience. A challenge
                               enforces token acquisition using an interstitial JavaScript challenge
                               that inspects the client session for legitimate behavior. The challenge

                               bots. After the client session successfully responds to the challenge,
                               it receives a new token from WAF, which the challenge script uses to resubmit
                               the original request.

                            You can configure the expiration time in the ChallengeConfig ImmunityTimeProperty
                            setting at the rule and web ACL level. The rule setting overrides the web
                            ACL setting.

                            This action option is available for rules. It isn't available for web ACL

                                   * In a rule statement, this is the part of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect. Include the single FieldToMatch type that you want to
                                   inspect, with additional specifications as needed, according to the type.
                                   You specify a single request component in FieldToMatch for each rule statement
                                   that requires it. To inspect more than one component of the web request,
                                   create a separate rule statement for each component. Example JSON for
                                   a QueryString field to match: "FieldToMatch": { "QueryString": {} } Example
                                   JSON for a Method field to match specification: "FieldToMatch": { "Method":

                                   * In a logging configuration, this is used in the RedactedFields property
                                   to specify a field to redact from the logging records. For this use case,
                                   note the following: Even though all FieldToMatch settings are available,
                                   the only valid settings for field redaction are UriPath, QueryString,
                                   SingleHeader, and Method. In this documentation, the descriptions of the
                                   individual fields talk about specifying the web request component to inspect,
                                   but for field redaction, you are specifying the component type to redact
                                   from the logs. If you have request sampling enabled, the redacted fields
                                   configuration for logging has no impact on sampling. The only way to exclude
                                   fields from request sampling is by disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility
                                   configuration.

                                    Balancers. Match against the request's JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint
                                    is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request.
                                    This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the client's TLS configuration.
                                    WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough
                                    TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests
                                    include this information.

                                    You can use this choice only with a string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                    the PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY.

                                    You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs.
                                    If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs.
                                    For information about the logging fields, see Log fields (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html)

                                    specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

                            A rule statement that labels web requests by country and region and that
                            matches against web requests based on country code. A geo match rule labels
                            every request that it inspects regardless of whether it finds a match.

                               * To manage requests only by country, you can use this statement by itself
                               and specify the countries that you want to match against in the CountryCodes
                               array.

                               * Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count action so that it
                               only labels requests. Then, add one or more label match rules to run after
                               the geo match rule and configure them to match against the geographic
                               labels and handle the requests as needed.

                            WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and region codes from the International
                            Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF determines the
                            codes using either the IP address in the web request origin or, if you specify
                            it, the address in the geo match ForwardedIPConfig.

                            If you use the web request origin, the label formats are awswaf:clientip:geo:region:-
                            and awswaf:clientip:geo:country:.

                            If you use a forwarded IP address, the label formats are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:-
                            and awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:.

                            A rule statement used to detect web requests coming from particular IP addresses
                            or address ranges. To use this, create an IPSet that specifies the addresses
                            you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. To create
                            an IP set, see CreateIPSet.

                            Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You create and maintain
                            the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set
                            in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically
                            updates all rules that reference it.

                            The label match statement provides the label or namespace string to search
                            for. The label string can represent a part or all of the fully qualified
                            label name that had been added to the web request. Fully qualified labels
                            have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label name. The prefix identifies
                            the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that added the label. If you
                            do not provide the fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF performs
                            the search for labels that were added in the same context as the label match
                            statement.

                                  configuration:

                                     * Use the AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet configuration object to configure
                                     the account creation fraud prevention managed rule group. The configuration
                                     includes the registration and sign-up pages of your application and the
                                     locations in the account creation request payload of data, such as the
                                     user email and phone number fields.

                                     * Use the AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet configuration object to configure
                                     the account takeover prevention managed rule group. The configuration
                                     includes the sign-in page of your application and the locations in the
                                     login request payload of data such as the username and password.

                                     * Use the AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet configuration object to configure
                                     the protection level that you want the Bot Control rule group to use.

                                          The rule groups evaluates the responses that your protected resources send
                                          back to client login and account creation attempts, keeping count of successful

                                          the rule group labels and mitigates requests from client sessions and IP

                                          Specifies that WAF should run a Challenge check against the request to verify
                                          that the request is coming from a legitimate client session:

                                             * If the request includes a valid, unexpired challenge token, WAF applies
                                             any custom request handling and labels that you've configured and then
                                             allows the web request inspection to proceed to the next rule, similar
                                             to a CountAction.

                                             * If the request doesn't include a valid, unexpired challenge token, WAF
                                             discontinues the web ACL evaluation of the request and blocks it from
                                             going to its intended destination. WAF then generates a challenge response
                                             that it sends back to the client, which includes the following: The header
                                             x-amzn-waf-action with a value of challenge. The HTTP status code 202
                                             Request Accepted. If the request contains an Accept header with a value
                                             of text/html, the response includes a JavaScript page interstitial with
                                             a challenge script. Challenges run silent browser interrogations in the
                                             background, and don't generally affect the end user experience. A challenge
                                             enforces token acquisition using an interstitial JavaScript challenge
                                             that inspects the client session for legitimate behavior. The challenge
                                             blocks bots or at least increases the cost of operating sophisticated
                                             bots. After the client session successfully responds to the challenge,
                                             it receives a new token from WAF, which the challenge script uses to resubmit
                                             the original request.

                                          You can configure the expiration time in the ChallengeConfig ImmunityTimeProperty
                                          setting at the rule and web ACL level. The rule setting overrides the web

                          description: |-
                            A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when
                            they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according
                            to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and
                            counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.

                            If you change any of these settings in a rule that's currently in use, the
                            change resets the rule's rate limiting counts. This can pause the rule's
                            rate limiting activities for up to a minute.

                            You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method.
                            You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP
                            method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

                            Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a
                            separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing
                            to the aggregation instance definition.

                            For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP
                            address and HTTP method values:

                               * IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                               * IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               * IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                               * IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                            The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation
                            criteria, for example:

                               * If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual
                               address is an aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests separately
                               for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example
                               would be the following: IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3 IP address 127.0.0.0:
                               count 1

                               * If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP
                               method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request
                               counts for our example would be the following: HTTP method POST: count
                               2 HTTP method GET: count 2

                               * If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each
                               IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation
                               instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example
                               would be the following: IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
                               IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2 IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP
                               method POST: count 1

                            For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for
                            the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits
                            individually.

                            You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement,
                            to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests
                            that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement
                            in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count
                            and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without
                            additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that
                            match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the
                            rule.

                            You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside another statement, for example
                            inside a NotStatement or OrStatement. You can define a RateBasedStatement
                            inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                            For additional information about the options, see Rate limiting web requests
                            using rate-based rules (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html)

                            If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address,
                            you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting
                            for a rule through the API call GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys. This option
                            is not available for other aggregation configurations.

                            WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based
                            rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings
                            in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance
                            of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If
                            you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule
                            group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based
                            rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

                                      Specifies the first IP address in an HTTP header as an aggregate key for
                                      a rate-based rule. Each distinct forwarded IP address contributes to the
                                      aggregation instance.

                                      This setting is used only in the RateBasedStatementCustomKey specification
                                      of a rate-based rule statement. When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in
                                      the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to
                                      use. You can aggregate on only the forwarded IP address by specifying FORWARDED_IP
                                      in your rate-based statement's AggregateKeyType.

                                      This data type supports using the forwarded IP address in the web request
                                      aggregation for a rate-based rule, in RateBasedStatementCustomKey. The JSON
                                      specification for using the forwarded IP address doesn't explicitly use this
                                      data type.

                                      JSON specification: "ForwardedIP": {}

                                      When you use this specification, you must also configure the forwarded IP
                                      address in the rate-based statement's ForwardedIPConfig.

                                      contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just one label namespace
                                      as your custom key, then each label name fully defines an aggregation instance.

                                      This uses only labels that have been added to the request by rules that are

                                origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify

                                If the specified header isn't present in the request, WAF doesn't apply the
                                rule to the web request at all.

                                in a logging configuration.

                                   * In a rule statement, this is the part of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect. Include the single FieldToMatch type that you want to
                                   inspect, with additional specifications as needed, according to the type.
                                   You specify a single request component in FieldToMatch for each rule statement
                                   that requires it. To inspect more than one component of the web request,
                                   create a separate rule statement for each component. Example JSON for
                                   a QueryString field to match: "FieldToMatch": { "QueryString": {} } Example

                                   * In a logging configuration, this is used in the RedactedFields property
                                   to specify a field to redact from the logging records. For this use case,
                                   note the following: Even though all FieldToMatch settings are available,
                                   the only valid settings for field redaction are UriPath, QueryString,
                                   SingleHeader, and Method. In this documentation, the descriptions of the
                                   individual fields talk about specifying the web request component to inspect,
                                   but for field redaction, you are specifying the component type to redact
                                   from the logs. If you have request sampling enabled, the redacted fields
                                   configuration for logging has no impact on sampling. The only way to exclude
                                   fields from request sampling is by disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility
                                   configuration.

                                    Balancers. Match against the request's JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint
                                    is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request.
                                    This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the client's TLS configuration.
                                    WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough
                                    TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests
                                    include this information.

                                    You can use this choice only with a string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                    the PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY.

                                    You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs.
                                    If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs.
                                    For information about the logging fields, see Log fields (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html)

                                    Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match statement
                                    specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

                            A web request matches the pattern set rule statement if the request component

                                   that requires it. To inspect more than one component of the web request,
                                   create a separate rule statement for each component. Example JSON for

                                   note the following: Even though all FieldToMatch settings are available,
                                   the only valid settings for field redaction are UriPath, QueryString,
                                   SingleHeader, and Method. In this documentation, the descriptions of the
                                   individual fields talk about specifying the web request component to inspect,
                                   but for field redaction, you are specifying the component type to redact
                                   from the logs. If you have request sampling enabled, the redacted fields
                                   configuration for logging has no impact on sampling. The only way to exclude
                                   fields from request sampling is by disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility
                                   configuration.

                                    Balancers. Match against the request's JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint
                                    is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request.
                                    This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the client's TLS configuration.
                                    WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough
                                    TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests
                                    include this information.

                                    You can use this choice only with a string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                    the PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY.

                                    You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs.
                                    If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs.
                                    For information about the logging fields, see Log fields (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html)

                                    specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

                                  how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently

                                              You can add custom request handling for WAF to use when the rule action doesn't
                                              block the request. For example, CaptchaAction for requests with valid t okens,
                                              and AllowAction.

                                          Specifies that WAF should run a CAPTCHA check against the request:

                                             * If the request includes a valid, unexpired CAPTCHA token, WAF applies
                                             any custom request handling and labels that you've configured and then
                                             allows the web request inspection to proceed to the next rule, similar
                                             to a CountAction.

                                             * If the request doesn't include a valid, unexpired token, WAF discontinues
                                             the web ACL evaluation of the request and blocks it from going to its
                                             intended destination. WAF generates a response that it sends back to the
                                             client, which includes the following: The header x-amzn-waf-action with
                                             a value of captcha. The HTTP status code 405 Method Not Allowed. If the
                                             request contains an Accept header with a value of text/html, the response
                                             includes a CAPTCHA JavaScript page interstitial.

                                          You can configure the expiration time in the CaptchaConfig ImmunityTimeProperty
                                          setting at the rule and web ACL level. The rule setting overrides the web
                                          ACL setting.

                                          This action option is available for rules. It isn't available for web ACL
                                          default actions.

                                              block the request. For example, CaptchaAction for requests with valid t okens,

                                          Specifies that WAF should run a Challenge check against the request to verify
                                          that the request is coming from a legitimate client session:

                                             * If the request includes a valid, unexpired challenge token, WAF applies
                                             any custom request handling and labels that you've configured and then

                                             to a CountAction.

                                             * If the request doesn't include a valid, unexpired challenge token, WAF
                                             discontinues the web ACL evaluation of the request and blocks it from
                                             going to its intended destination. WAF then generates a challenge response
                                             that it sends back to the client, which includes the following: The header
                                             x-amzn-waf-action with a value of challenge. The HTTP status code 202
                                             Request Accepted. If the request contains an Accept header with a value
                                             of text/html, the response includes a JavaScript page interstitial with
                                             a challenge script. Challenges run silent browser interrogations in the
                                             background, and don't generally affect the end user experience. A challenge
                                             enforces token acquisition using an interstitial JavaScript challenge
                                             that inspects the client session for legitimate behavior. The challenge
                                             blocks bots or at least increases the cost of operating sophisticated
                                             bots. After the client session successfully responds to the challenge,
                                             it receives a new token from WAF, which the challenge script uses to resubmit
                                             the original request.

                                          You can configure the expiration time in the ChallengeConfig ImmunityTimeProperty
                                          setting at the rule and web ACL level. The rule setting overrides the web

                                   note the following: Even though all FieldToMatch settings are available,
                                   the only valid settings for field redaction are UriPath, QueryString,
                                   SingleHeader, and Method. In this documentation, the descriptions of the
                                   individual fields talk about specifying the web request component to inspect,
                                   but for field redaction, you are specifying the component type to redact
                                   from the logs. If you have request sampling enabled, the redacted fields
                                   configuration for logging has no impact on sampling. The only way to exclude
                                   fields from request sampling is by disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility
                                   configuration.

                                    Balancers. Match against the request's JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint
                                    is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request.
                                    This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the client's TLS configuration.
                                    WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough
                                    TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests
                                    include this information.

                                    You can use this choice only with a string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                    the PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY.

                                    You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs.
                                    If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs.
                                    For information about the logging fields, see Log fields (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html)

                                   that requires it. To inspect more than one component of the web request,
                                   create a separate rule statement for each component. Example JSON for

                                   to specify a field to redact from the logging records. For this use case,
                                   note the following: Even though all FieldToMatch settings are available,
                                   the only valid settings for field redaction are UriPath, QueryString,
                                   SingleHeader, and Method. In this documentation, the descriptions of the
                                   individual fields talk about specifying the web request component to inspect,
                                   but for field redaction, you are specifying the component type to redact
                                   from the logs. If you have request sampling enabled, the redacted fields
                                   configuration for logging has no impact on sampling. The only way to exclude
                                   fields from request sampling is by disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility
                                   configuration.

                                    Balancers. Match against the request's JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint
                                    is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request.
                                    This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the client's TLS configuration.
                                    WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough
                                    TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests
                                    include this information.

                                    You can use this choice only with a string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                    the PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY.

                                    You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs.
                                    If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs.
                                    For information about the logging fields, see Log fields (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html)

                            A rule statement that inspects for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In
                            XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle
                            to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web browsers.

                                Specifies a web request component to be used in a rule match statement or
                                in a logging configuration.

                                   * In a rule statement, this is the part of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect. Include the single FieldToMatch type that you want to
                                   inspect, with additional specifications as needed, according to the type.
                                   You specify a single request component in FieldToMatch for each rule statement
                                   that requires it. To inspect more than one component of the web request,
                                   create a separate rule statement for each component. Example JSON for
                                   a QueryString field to match: "FieldToMatch": { "QueryString": {} } Example
                                   JSON for a Method field to match specification: "FieldToMatch": { "Method":
                                   { "Name": "DELETE" } }

                                   * In a logging configuration, this is used in the RedactedFields property
                                   to specify a field to redact from the logging records. For this use case,
                                   note the following: Even though all FieldToMatch settings are available,
                                   the only valid settings for field redaction are UriPath, QueryString,
                                   SingleHeader, and Method. In this documentation, the descriptions of the
                                   individual fields talk about specifying the web request component to inspect,
                                   but for field redaction, you are specifying the component type to redact
                                   from the logs. If you have request sampling enabled, the redacted fields
                                   configuration for logging has no impact on sampling. The only way to exclude
                                   fields from request sampling is by disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility
                                   configuration.

                                    Balancers. Match against the request's JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint
                                    is a 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming request.
                                    This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for the client's TLS configuration.
                                    WAF calculates and logs this fingerprint for each request that has enough
                                    TLS Client Hello information for the calculation. Almost all web requests
                                    include this information.

                                    You can use this choice only with a string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                    the PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY.

                                    You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL logs.
                                    If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in the logs.
                                    For information about the logging fields, see Log fields (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html)

                                    specification, to match with any future requests that have the same TLS configuration.

                  to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and
                  delete.

                description: |-
                  A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get and
                  list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request.
                  To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the
                  token to operations like update and delete. WAF uses the token to ensure
                  that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it.
                  If a change has been made, the update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException.
                  If this happens, perform another get, and use the new token returned by that
                  operation.
