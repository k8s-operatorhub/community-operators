              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

                  Conditions is a list of conditions for quality gate.
                  Key is a metric name, value is a condition.
                example:
                  new_code_smells:
                    error: "10"

              default:
                description: |-
                  Default is a flag to set quality gate as default.
                  Only one quality gate can be default.
                  If several quality gates have default flag, the random one will be chosen.
                  Default quality gate can't be deleted. You need to set another quality gate as default before.
                example: "true"
                type: boolean
              name:
                description: |-
                  Name is a name of quality gate.
                  Name should be unique across all quality gates.
                  Don't change this field after creation otherwise quality gate will be recreated.
