                            dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                            provisioner.
                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                              specified.
                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                              in any namespaces.
                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                              provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                        RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                        recursively.


                        If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.


                        If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                        recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                        recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                        field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                        supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                        an error will be generated to indicate the reason.


                        If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                        None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).


                        If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.
