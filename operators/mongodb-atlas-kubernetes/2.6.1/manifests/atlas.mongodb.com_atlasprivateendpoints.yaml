          The AtlasPrivateEndpoint custom resource definition (CRD) defines a desired [Private Endpoint](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-private-endpoint/#std-label-private-endpoint-overview) configuration for an Atlas project.
          It allows a private connection between your cloud provider and Atlas that doesn't send information through a public network.

          You can use private endpoints to create a unidirectional connection to Atlas clusters from your virtual network.
