        description: CouchbaseScopeGroup represents a logical unit of data storage
          that sits between buckets and collections e.g. a bucket may contain multiple
          scopes, and a scope may contain multiple collections.  At present, scopes
          are not nested, so provide only a single level of abstraction.  Scopes provide
          a coarser grained basis for role-based access control (RBAC) and cross-datacenter
          replication (XDCR) than collections, but finer that buckets. In order to
          be considered by the Operator, a scope must be referenced by either a `CouchbaseBucket`
          or `CouchbaseEphemeralBucket` resource. Unlike `CouchbaseScope` resources,
          scope groups represents multiple scopes, with the same common set of collections,
          to be expressed as a single resource, minimizing required configuration
          and Kubernetes API traffic.  It also forms the basis of Couchbase RBAC security
          boundaries.
