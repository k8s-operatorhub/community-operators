                  well as by APIOperations to coordinate Recipe activity. Note that
                  formation-controller uses FormationState, not ResourceState. See
                  RecipeStatus for more details on the use of ResourceState by recipe-controller.
                  \n The awkwardness here is due to APIOperations' need for a consistent
                  type across resources to allow flexibility to Recipe authors. If
                  and when APIOperations are deprecated, the scope of ResourceState
                  will be reduced. \n ResourceState should be considered deprecated
