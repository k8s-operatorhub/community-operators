                                The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                      Additionally, in SC mode clusters, these pods are removed from the roster.
                      This is particularly useful when some pods are stuck in pending/failed state due to any scheduling issues and
                      cannot be fixed by simply updating the CR.
                      It enables the operator to perform specific operations on the cluster, like changing Aerospike configurations,
                      without being hindered by these problematic pods.
                      Remember to set MaxIgnorablePods back to 0 once the required operation is done.
                      This makes sure that later on, all pods are properly counted when evaluating the cluster stability.

                                              MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                              be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                              incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                              to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                              for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                              pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                              The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                              Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                              This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                      assessing cluster stability. Pods identified using this value are not considered part of the cluster.
                      Additionally, in SC mode clusters, these pods are removed from the roster.
                      This is particularly useful when some pods are stuck in pending/failed state due to any scheduling issues and
                      cannot be fixed by simply updating the CR.
                      It enables the operator to perform specific operations on the cluster, like changing Aerospike configurations,
                      without being hindered by these problematic pods.
                      Remember to set MaxIgnorablePods back to 0 once the required operation is done.
                      This makes sure that later on, all pods are properly counted when evaluating the cluster stability.

                                      Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                      tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                      TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be

                                      it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                      negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                      If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                        Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                            Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable

                            to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will

                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                                a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                                Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                                              MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                              be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                              incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                              to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                              for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                              pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                              The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                              Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                              This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                  and any traffic that is sent to this port is forwarded to the service.
                  Here service picks a random port in range (30000-32767), so these port should be open.


                  If set false then only single pod can be created per Kubernetes Node.
                  This will create Pods using hostPort setting.

                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                                PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                                              for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                              pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                              The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                              Also, MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                              This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                                  MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                  be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                  incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                  to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                  for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                  pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                  The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                                  Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                                  This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.
