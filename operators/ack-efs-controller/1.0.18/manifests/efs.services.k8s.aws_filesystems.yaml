                     * Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

                     * Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example
                     alias/projectKey1.

                     * Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1.

                  If you use KmsKeyId, you must set the CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted parameter
                  to true.

                  EFS accepts only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot use asymmetric KMS keys with

                     current storage class (either IA or Standard storage) into the Archive
                     storage. File systems cannot transition into Archive storage before transitioning
                     into IA storage. Therefore, TransitionToArchive must either not be set
                     or must be later than TransitionToIA. The Archive storage class is available
                     only for file systems that use the Elastic throughput mode and the General
                     Purpose performance mode.

                     system back to primary storage (Standard storage class) after they are
                     accessed in IA or Archive storage.

                  When using the put-lifecycle-configuration CLI command or the PutLifecycleConfiguration

                  The maxIO mode is not supported on One Zone file systems.

                  You can add tags to a file system, including a Name tag. For more information,

                  the value in this field.

              sizeInBytes:
                description: |-
                  The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system,
                  in its Value field, and the time at which that size was determined in its
                  Timestamp field. The Timestamp value is the integer number of seconds since
                  1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The SizeInBytes value doesn't represent the size of
                  a consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent
                  when there are no writes to the file system. That is, SizeInBytes represents
                  actual size only if the file system is not modified for a period longer than
                  a couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size that the file
                  system was at any point in time.
