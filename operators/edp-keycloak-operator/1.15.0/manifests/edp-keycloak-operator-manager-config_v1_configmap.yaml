    requires the binary to immediately end when the\n#   Manager is stopped, otherwise,
    this setting is unsafe. Setting this significantly\n#   speeds up voluntary leader
    transitions as the new leader don't have to wait\n#   LeaseDuration time first.\n#
    \  In the default scaffold provided, the program ends immediately after \n#   the
    manager stops, so would be fine to enable this option. However, \n#   if you are
    doing or is intended to do any operation such as perform cleanups \n#   after
    the manager stops then its usage might be unsafe.\n#   leaderElectionReleaseOnCancel:
