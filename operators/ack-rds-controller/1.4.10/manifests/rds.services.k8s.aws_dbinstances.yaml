                  Aurora automatically chooses an appropriate Availability Zone if you don't
                  specify one.

                  Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's Amazon

                  Constraints:

                     * Must contain 1 to 64 letters or numbers.

                     * Must begin with a letter. Subsequent characters can be letters, underscores,
                     or digits (0-9).

                     * Can't be a word reserved by the specified database engine.

                  RDS for MySQL

                  The name of the database to create when the DB instance is created. If this
                  parameter isn't specified, no database is created in the DB instance.

                  Constraints:

                     * Must contain 1 to 64 letters or numbers.

                  RDS for Oracle

                  The Oracle System ID (SID) of the created DB instance. If you don't specify
                  a value, the default value is ORCL. You can't specify the string null, or

                  RDS for PostgreSQL

                  The name of the database to create when the DB instance is created. A database
                  named postgres is always created. If this parameter is specified, an additional
                  database with this name is created.

                  Constraints:

                     * Must contain 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or underscores.

                  API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that
                  contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must

                     one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation is called that contains
                     this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance

                     in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica
                     operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned

                     in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the DestinationRegion
                     in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services
                     Region.

                     * KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the
                     read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the
                     same identifier for both the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation that
                     is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation
                     contained in the presigned URL.

                     * SourceDBInstanceIdentifier - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted
                     DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource
                     Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example,
                     if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the
                     us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier
                     looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115.

                  and Signature Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

                  If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify
                  SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl
                  manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a
                  valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services
                  Region.

                  Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

                  When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from outside
                  of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System
                  (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within
                  the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP
                  address. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security
                  group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the security group
                  assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

                  When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance
                  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                  Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnetGroupName
                  is specified.

                  If DBSubnetGroupName isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified,
                  the following applies:

                     * If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway
                     attached to it, the DB instance is private.

                     * If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached
                     to it, the DB instance is public.

                  If DBSubnetGroupName is specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified,
                  the following applies:

                     * If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway
                     attached to it, the DB instance is private.

                     * If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached
                     to it, the DB instance is public.

              replicaMode:

                  The open mode of the replica database: mounted or read-only.

                  This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

                  Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The
                  main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The
                  primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to
                  the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted
                  replica can't serve a read-only workload.

                  You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the
                  same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with Oracle Read

                  in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                  For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to mounted. The
                  value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the

                        Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                        To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the
                        Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore
                        feature name for the Name parameter.

                        You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance
                        when you call one of the following actions:

                           * CreateDBInstance

                           * ModifyDBInstance

                           * RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                           * RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                           * RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                        You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by
                        calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the
                        instance class for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                        In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor
                        information:

                           * DescribeDBInstances

                           * DescribeDBSnapshots

                           * DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                        If you call DescribeDBInstances, ProcessorFeature returns non-null values
                        only if the following conditions are met:

                           * You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                           * Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU
                           cores and threads per core.

                           * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.
