                                    is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule
                                    if the http host header is to equal to the suffix

                                    are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue
                                    can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent
                                    Ingress. 2. The `:` delimiter is not respected
                                    because ports are not allowed. Currently the port
                                    of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443
                                    for https. Both these may change in the future.
                                    Incoming requests are matched against the host
                                    before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified,
                                    the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified
                                    IngressRuleValue. \n Host can be \"precise\" which
                                    is a domain name without the terminating dot of
                                    a network host (e.g. \"foo.bar.com\") or \"wildcard\",
                                    which is a domain name prefixed with a single
                                    wildcard label (e.g. \"*.foo.com\"). The wildcard

                                    == \"*\"). Requests will be matched against the
                                    Host field in the following way: 1. If Host is
                                    precise, the request matches this rule if the
                                    http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host
                                    is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule
                                    if the http host header is to equal to the suffix
                                    (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule."

                                    are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue
                                    can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent
                                    Ingress. 2. The `:` delimiter is not respected
                                    because ports are not allowed. Currently the port
                                    of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443
                                    for https. Both these may change in the future.
                                    Incoming requests are matched against the host
                                    before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified,
                                    the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified
                                    IngressRuleValue. \n Host can be \"precise\" which
                                    is a domain name without the terminating dot of
                                    a network host (e.g. \"foo.bar.com\") or \"wildcard\",
                                    which is a domain name prefixed with a single
                                    wildcard label (e.g. \"*.foo.com\"). The wildcard

                                    == \"*\"). Requests will be matched against the
                                    Host field in the following way: 1. If Host is
                                    precise, the request matches this rule if the
                                    http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host
                                    is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule
                                    if the http host header is to equal to the suffix
                                    (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule."

                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
