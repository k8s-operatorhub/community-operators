                  Runtime is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. Specifying
                  a runtime results in an error if you're deploying a function using a container
                  image.

                  The following list includes deprecated runtimes. Lambda blocks creating new
                  functions and updating existing functions shortly after each runtime is deprecated.
                  For more information, see Runtime use after deprecation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtime-deprecation-levels).

                  For a list of all currently supported runtimes, see Supported runtimes (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtimes-supported).
