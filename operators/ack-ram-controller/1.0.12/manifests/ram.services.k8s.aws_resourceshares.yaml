                     * STANDARD – A resource share that supports all functionality. These
                     resource shares are visible to all principals you share the resource share
                     with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using the console or
                     APIs. This resource share might have been created by RAM, or it might
                     have been CREATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

                     * CREATED_FROM_POLICY – The customer manually shared a resource by attaching
                     a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any existing managed
                     permissions, so RAM created this customer managed permission automatically
                     on the customer's behalf based on the attached policy document. This type
                     of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web Services account that
                     created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you promote it. For more
                     information, see PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.

                     * PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD – This resource share was originally CREATED_FROM_POLICY,
                     but the customer ran the PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that
                     operation is still in progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.
