                          Heads up: in an earlier version this had a default value of "fence-agents-credentials-shared".
                          We removed that default to be able to differentiate during CR validation between using a Secret or not.

                          As a temporary workaround this field will be set with the old default value in case a Secret with the
                          old default of "fence-agents-credentials-shared" is found. Also, in case the field contains the old default
                          value, but the Secret does not exist, the value will be deleted. This workaround will be removed in a future version.
