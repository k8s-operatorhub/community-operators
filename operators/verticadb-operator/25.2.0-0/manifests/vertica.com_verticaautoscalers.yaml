                  This defines how the scaling will happen.  This can be one of the following:
                  - Subcluster: Scaling will be achieved by creating or deleting entire subclusters.
                    The template for new subclusters are either the template if filled out
                    or an existing subcluster that matches the service name.
                  - Pod: Only increase or decrease the size of an existing subcluster.
                    If multiple subclusters are selected by the serviceName, this will grow
                    the last subcluster only.
                type: string
              serviceName:
                description: |-
                  This acts as a selector for the subclusters that are being scaled together.
                  Each subcluster has a service name field, which if omitted is the same
                  name as the subcluster name.  Multiple subclusters that have the same
                  service name use the same service object.
                  if this field is empty, all the subclusters will be selected for scaling.

              targetSize:

                  This is the total pod count for all subclusters that match the
                  serviceName.  Changing this value may trigger a change in the
                  VerticaDB that is associated with this object.  This value is generally
                  left as zero.  It will get initialized in the operator and then modified
                  via the /scale subresource.

                type: integer
              template:
                description: |-
                  When the scaling granularity is Subcluster, this field defines a template
                  to use for when a new subcluster needs to be created.  If size is 0, then
                  the operator will use an existing subcluster to use as the template.  If
                  size is > 0 service name must match the serviceName parameter (if non-empty).


                  If the serviceName parameter is empty, service name can be an existing service and
                  in that case the new subcluster will share it with other(s) subcluster, service
                  name can also be non-existing and all the subclusters created from the template
                  will share that service. If service name is empty, each new subcluster will have its
                  own service.


                  The name of the new subcluster is always auto generated.  If the name is set
                  here it will be used as a prefix for the new subcluster.  Otherwise, we
                  use the name of this VerticaAutoscaler object as a prefix for all
                  subclusters.

                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both matchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                        Also, matchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                    The template for new subclusters are either the template if filled out
                    or an existing subcluster that matches the service name.
                  - Pod: Only increase or decrease the size of an existing subcluster.
                    If multiple subclusters are selected by the serviceName, this will grow
                    the last subcluster only.

                  This acts as a selector for the subclusters that are being scaled together.
                  Each subcluster has a service name field, which if omitted is the same
                  name as the subcluster name.  Multiple subclusters that have the same
                  service name use the same service object.
                  if this field is empty, all the subclusters will be selected for scaling.

                  VerticaDB that is associated with this object.  This value is generally
                  left as zero.  It will get initialized in the operator and then modified
                  via the /scale subresource.

              template:
                description: |-
                  When the scaling granularity is Subcluster, this field defines a template
                  to use for when a new subcluster needs to be created.  If size is 0, then
                  the operator will use an existing subcluster to use as the template.  If
                  size is > 0 service name must match the serviceName parameter (if non-empty).


                  If the serviceName parameter is empty, service name can be an existing service and
                  in that case the new subcluster will share it with other(s) subcluster, service
                  name can also be non-existing and all the subclusters created from the template
                  will share that service. If service name is empty, each new subcluster will have its
                  own service.


                  The name of the new subcluster is always auto generated.  If the name is set
                  here it will be used as a prefix for the new subcluster.  Otherwise, we
                  use the name of this VerticaAutoscaler object as a prefix for all
                  subclusters.

                        The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
                        the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.
                      properties:
                        effect:
                          description: |-
                            Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                            When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
                          type: string
                        key:
                          description: |-
                            Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                            If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
                          type: string
                        operator:
                          description: |-
                            Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                            Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.
                          type: string
                        tolerationSeconds:
                          description: |-
                            TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                            of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                            it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                            negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                            Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                            If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                      must be defined within the range allocated by the control plane, if
                      omitted Kubernetes will choose the port automatically.
