                  copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource    Name (ARN)
                  format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example,    if
                  you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 Amazon
                  Web    Services Region, then your ReplicationSourceIdentifier would
                  look like    Example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1.

                  Services Signature Version 4) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html)
                  and Signature Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
                  \n If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI,
                  you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead
                  of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates
                  a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that
                  can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region."

                  among the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality
                  can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas
                  in your DB cluster. \n If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica
                  that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance,
                  your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload
                  to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect
