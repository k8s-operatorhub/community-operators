              CertificateAuthoritySpec defines the desired state of CertificateAuthority.

              Contains information about your private certificate authority (CA). Your
              private CA can issue and revoke X.509 digital certificates. Digital certificates
              verify that the entity named in the certificate Subject field owns or controls
              the public key contained in the Subject Public Key Info field. Call the CreateCertificateAuthority
              (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthority.html)
              action to create your private CA. You must then call the GetCertificateAuthorityCertificate
              (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_GetCertificateAuthorityCertificate.html)
              action to retrieve a private CA certificate signing request (CSR). Sign the
              CSR with your Amazon Web Services Private CA-hosted or on-premises root or
              subordinate CA certificate. Call the ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate
              (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate.html)
              action to import the signed certificate into Certificate Manager (ACM).

                  Specifies a cryptographic key management compliance standard used for handling
                  CA keys.

                  Default: FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_3_OR_HIGHER

                  Some Amazon Web Services Regions do not support the default. When creating
                  a CA in these Regions, you must provide FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_2_OR_HIGHER as the
                  argument for KeyStorageSecurityStandard. Failure to do this results in an
                  InvalidArgsException with the message, "A certificate authority cannot be
                  created in this region with the specified security standard."

                  For information about security standard support in various Regions, see Storage
                  and security compliance of Amazon Web Services Private CA private keys (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#private-keys).

                  (OCSP), certificate revocation list (CRL), both protocols, or neither. By
                  default, both certificate validation mechanisms are disabled.

                  The following requirements apply to revocation configurations.

                     * A configuration disabling CRLs or OCSP must contain only the Enabled=False
                     parameter, and will fail if other parameters such as CustomCname or ExpirationInDays
                     are included.

                     * In a CRL configuration, the S3BucketName parameter must conform to Amazon
                     S3 bucket naming rules (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).

                     * A configuration containing a custom Canonical Name (CNAME) parameter
                     for CRLs or OCSP must conform to RFC2396 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt)
                     restrictions on the use of special characters in a CNAME.

                     * In a CRL or OCSP configuration, the value of a CNAME parameter must
                     not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

                  For more information, see the OcspConfiguration (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_OcspConfiguration.html)
                  and CrlConfiguration (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CrlConfiguration.html)

                      Contains configuration information for a certificate revocation list (CRL).
                      Your private certificate authority (CA) creates base CRLs. Delta CRLs are
                      not supported. You can enable CRLs for your new or an existing private CA
                      by setting the Enabled parameter to true. Your private CA writes CRLs to
                      an S3 bucket that you specify in the S3BucketName parameter. You can hide
                      the name of your bucket by specifying a value for the CustomCname parameter.
                      Your private CA by default copies the CNAME or the S3 bucket name to the
                      CRL Distribution Points extension of each certificate it issues. If you want
                      to configure this default behavior to be something different, you can set
                      the CrlDistributionPointExtensionConfiguration parameter. Your S3 bucket
                      policy must give write permission to Amazon Web Services Private CA.

                      Amazon Web Services Private CA assets that are stored in Amazon S3 can be
                      protected with encryption. For more information, see Encrypting Your CRLs
                      (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/crl-planning.html#crl-encryption).

                      Your private CA uses the value in the ExpirationInDays parameter to calculate
                      the nextUpdate field in the CRL. The CRL is refreshed prior to a certificate's
                      expiration date or when a certificate is revoked. When a certificate is revoked,
                      it appears in the CRL until the certificate expires, and then in one additional
                      CRL after expiration, and it always appears in the audit report.

                      A CRL is typically updated approximately 30 minutes after a certificate is
                      revoked. If for any reason a CRL update fails, Amazon Web Services Private
                      CA makes further attempts every 15 minutes.

                      CRLs contain the following fields:

                         * Version: The current version number defined in RFC 5280 is V2. The integer
                         value is 0x1.

                         * Signature Algorithm: The name of the algorithm used to sign the CRL.

                         * Issuer: The X.500 distinguished name of your private CA that issued
                         the CRL.

                         * Last Update: The issue date and time of this CRL.

                         * Next Update: The day and time by which the next CRL will be issued.

                         * Revoked Certificates: List of revoked certificates. Each list item contains
                         the following information. Serial Number: The serial number, in hexadecimal
                         format, of the revoked certificate. Revocation Date: Date and time the
                         certificate was revoked. CRL Entry Extensions: Optional extensions for
                         the CRL entry. X509v3 CRL Reason Code: Reason the certificate was revoked.

                         * CRL Extensions: Optional extensions for the CRL. X509v3 Authority Key
                         Identifier: Identifies the public key associated with the private key
                         used to sign the certificate. X509v3 CRL Number:: Decimal sequence number
                         for the CRL.

                         * Signature Algorithm: Algorithm used by your private CA to sign the CRL.

                         * Signature Value: Signature computed over the CRL.

                      Certificate revocation lists created by Amazon Web Services Private CA are
                      DER-encoded. You can use the following OpenSSL command to list a CRL.

                      openssl crl -inform DER -text -in crl_path -noout
