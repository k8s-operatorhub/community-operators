                    Conditions should follow the "abnormal-true" principle in order
                    to only bring the attention of users to "broken" states. Example:
                    a condition of `type: "Ready", status: "True"“ is less useful
                    and should be omitted whereas `type: "NotReady", status: "True"`
                    is more useful when trying to monitor when something is wrong.'
