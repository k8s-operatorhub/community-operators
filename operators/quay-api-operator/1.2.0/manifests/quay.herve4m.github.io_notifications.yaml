                  to process. For 'state=present', the resource resets the failure

                  the resource deletes all the notifications that match. Uses Python
                  regular expressions. See <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>.

                  for the repository in your personal namespace. You can manage notifications
                  for repositories in your personal namespace, but not in the personal
                  namespace of other users. The token you use in 'quayToken' determines
