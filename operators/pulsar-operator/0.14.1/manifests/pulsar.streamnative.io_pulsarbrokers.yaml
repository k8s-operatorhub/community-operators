                                    non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                    backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource
                                    and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. There are two important differences
                                    between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While
                                    DataSource only allows two specific types of objects,
                                    DataSourceRef   allows any non-core object, as
                                    well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While
                                    DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), DataSourceRef   preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                                    (Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                                    feature gate to be enabled.'
