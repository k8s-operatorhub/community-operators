                            If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                            If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                            recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                            recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                            field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                            supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                            an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                            If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                            None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                            If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.
