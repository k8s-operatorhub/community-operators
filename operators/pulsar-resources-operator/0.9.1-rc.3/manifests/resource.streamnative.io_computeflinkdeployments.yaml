                                                MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                                This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                                    MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                    be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                    incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                    to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                    for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                    pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                    The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                    Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                                    This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.


                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                              If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
