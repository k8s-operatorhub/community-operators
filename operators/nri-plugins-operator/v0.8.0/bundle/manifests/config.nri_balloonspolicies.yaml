                        one hyperthread from each physical CPU core in the

                        containers in the balloon will be allowed to use 8 logical

                        all hyperthreads of each physical core into the same
                        balloon, but allow containers to use only one hyperthread
                        from each core. This will ensure that hidden hyperthreads

                          Expression describes some runtime-evaluated condition. An expression
                          consists of a key, an operator and a set of values. An expression is
                          evaluated against an object which implements the Evaluable interface.
                          Evaluating an expression consists of looking up the value for the key
                          in the object, then using the operator to check it against the values
                          of the expression. The result is a single boolean value. An object is
                          said to satisfy the evaluated expression if this value is true. An
                          expression can contain 0, 1 or more values depending on the operator.

                  (possibly hyperthreads) for a balloon from separate physical CPU
                  cores. This prevents workloads in the balloon from interfering with
                  themselves as they do not compete on the resources of the same CPU
                  cores. On the other hand, it allows more interference between
                  workloads in different balloons. The default is false: balloons
                  are packed tightly to a minimum number of physical CPU cores. The
                  value set here is the default for all balloon types, but it can be

                        Expression describes some runtime-evaluated condition. An expression
                        consists of a key, an operator and a set of values. An expression is
                        evaluated against an object which implements the Evaluable interface.
                        Evaluating an expression consists of looking up the value for the key
                        in the object, then using the operator to check it against the values
                        of the expression. The result is a single boolean value. An object is
                        said to satisfy the evaluated expression if this value is true. An
                        expression can contain 0, 1 or more values depending on the operator.
