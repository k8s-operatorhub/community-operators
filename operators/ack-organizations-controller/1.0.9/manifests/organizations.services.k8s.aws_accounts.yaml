                  account. You must use a valid email address to complete account creation.

                  The rules for a valid email address:

                     * All characters must be 7-bit ASCII characters.

                     * There must be one and only one @ symbol, which separates the local name
                     from the domain name.

                  If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to OrganizationAccountAccessRole.

                  set the value to an empty string, but you can't set it to null. For more
