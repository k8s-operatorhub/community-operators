              ResponseHeadersPolicySpec defines the desired state of ResponseHeadersPolicy.


              A response headers policy.


              A response headers policy contains information about a set of HTTP response
              headers.


              After you create a response headers policy, you can use its ID to attach
              it to one or more cache behaviors in a CloudFront distribution. When it's
              attached to a cache behavior, the response headers policy affects the HTTP
              headers that CloudFront includes in HTTP responses to requests that match
              the cache behavior. CloudFront adds or removes response headers according
              to the configuration of the response headers policy.


              For more information, see Adding or removing HTTP headers in CloudFront responses
              (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/modifying-response-headers.html)

                      You can use the Server-Timing header to view metrics that can help you gain
                      insights about the behavior and performance of CloudFront. For example, you
                      can see which cache layer served a cache hit, or the first byte latency from
                      the origin when there was a cache miss. You can use the metrics in the Server-Timing
                      header to troubleshoot issues or test the efficiency of your CloudFront configuration.
                      For more information, see Server-Timing header (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/understanding-response-headers-policies.html#server-timing-header)

                      ARN is the Amazon Resource Name for the resource. This is a
                      globally-unique identifier and is set only by the ACK service controller
                      once the controller has orchestrated the creation of the resource OR
                      when it has verified that an "adopted" resource (a resource where the
                      ARN annotation was set by the Kubernetes user on the CR) exists and
                      matches the supplied CR's Spec field values.
