                          an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource

                          an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource

                  there is only a single copy of all MySQL Cluster data and failure
                  of any Data node will cause the entire MySQL Cluster to fail. The
                  operator also implicitly decides the number of Management nodes
                  to be added to the MySQL Cluster configuration based on this value.
                  For a redundancy level of 1, one Management node will be created.
                  For 2 or higher, two Management nodes will be created. This value
