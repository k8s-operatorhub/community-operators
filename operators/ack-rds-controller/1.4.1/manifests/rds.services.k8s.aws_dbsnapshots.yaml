                    To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the

                    feature name for the Name parameter.


                    You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance
                    when you call one of the following actions:


                       * CreateDBInstance

                    You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by
                    calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the
                    instance class for the DBInstanceClass parameter.


                    In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor
                    information:


                       * DescribeDBInstances


                       * DescribeDBSnapshots


                       * DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications


                    If you call DescribeDBInstances, ProcessorFeature returns non-null values
                    only if the following conditions are met:


                       * You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.


                       * Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU
                       cores and threads per core.


                       * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.

                  originalSnapshotCreateTime specifies the system time that the snapshot completed.


                  If you back up a read replica, you can determine the replica lag by comparing
                  SnapshotDatabaseTime with originalSnapshotCreateTime. For example, if originalSnapshotCreateTime
