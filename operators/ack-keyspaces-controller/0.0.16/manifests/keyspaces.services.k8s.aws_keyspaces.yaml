                    Describes a tag. A tag is a key-value pair. You can add up to 50 tags to
                    a single Amazon Keyspaces resource.


                    Amazon Web Services-assigned tag names and values are automatically assigned
                    the aws: prefix, which the user cannot assign. Amazon Web Services-assigned
                    tag names do not count towards the tag limit of 50. User-assigned tag names
                    have the prefix user: in the Cost Allocation Report. You cannot backdate
                    the application of a tag.
