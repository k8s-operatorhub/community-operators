              A distribution tells CloudFront where you want content to be delivered from,

                            You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache
                            behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from
                            all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which
                            you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the
                            default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront
                            to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.


                            For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors
                            that you can add to a distribution, see Quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html)
                            in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.


                            If you don't want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty CacheBehaviors
                            element. Don't include an empty CacheBehavior element because this is invalid.


                            To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution
                            configuration and include only an empty CacheBehaviors element.


                            To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution
                            configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include
                            in the updated distribution.


                            For more information about cache behaviors, see Cache Behavior Settings (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior)

                                A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and
                                forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three
                                choices:


                                   * CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.


                                   * CloudFront forwards only GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests.


                                   * CloudFront forwards GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST, and DELETE
                                   requests.


                                If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon
                                S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that
                                you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions
                                to delete objects from your origin.

                                    A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests
                                    using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:


                                       * CloudFront caches responses to GET and HEAD requests.


                                       * CloudFront caches responses to GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests.


                                    If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to
                                    forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and
                                    Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.

                             * CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.


                             * CloudFront forwards only GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests.

                             requests.


                          If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon
                          S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that
                          you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions
                          to delete objects from your origin.

                              If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to
                              forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and
                              Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.

                            gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:


                               * Use S3OriginConfig to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured
                               with static website hosting.

                      A complex type that determines the distribution's SSL/TLS configuration for
                      communicating with viewers.


                      If the distribution doesn't use Aliases (also known as alternate domain names
                      or CNAMEs)—that is, if the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name
                      such as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net—set CloudFrontDefaultCertificate
                      to true and leave all other fields empty.


                      If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), use
                      the fields in this type to specify the following settings:


                         * Which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from: only
                         viewers that support server name indication (SNI) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication)
                         (recommended), or all viewers including those that don't support SNI.
                         To accept HTTPS connections from only viewers that support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod
                         to sni-only. This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI.
                         To accept HTTPS connections from all viewers, including those that don't
                         support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod to vip. This is not recommended, and
                         results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront.


                         * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that the distribution can use to
                         communicate with viewers. To specify a minimum version, choose a value
                         for MinimumProtocolVersion. For more information, see Security Policy
                         (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy)
                         in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.


                         * The location of the SSL/TLS certificate, Certificate Manager (ACM) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html)
                         (recommended) or Identity and Access Management (IAM) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html).
                         You specify the location by setting a value in one of the following fields
                         (not both): ACMCertificateArn IAMCertificateId


                      All distributions support HTTPS connections from viewers. To require viewers
                      to use HTTPS only, or to redirect them from HTTP to HTTPS, use ViewerProtocolPolicy
                      in the CacheBehavior or DefaultCacheBehavior. To specify how CloudFront should
                      use SSL/TLS to communicate with your custom origin, use CustomOriginConfig.
