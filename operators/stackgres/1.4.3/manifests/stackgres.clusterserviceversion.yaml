          Continuous Archiving backups are composed of periodic *base backups* and all the WAL segments produced in between those base backups. This parameter specifies at what time and with what frequency to start performing a new base backup.

          Use cron syntax (`m h dom mon dow`) for this parameter, i.e., 5 values separated by spaces:
          *  `m`: minute, 0 to 59
          *  `h`: hour, 0 to 23
          *  `dom`: day of month, 1 to 31 (recommended not to set it higher than 28)
          *  `mon`: month, 1 to 12
          *  `dow`: day of week, 0 to 7 (0 and 7 both represent Sunday)

          Also ranges of values (`start-end`), the symbol `*` (meaning `first-last`) or even `*/N`, where `N` is a number, meaning every `N`, may be used. All times are UTC. It is recommended to avoid 00:00 as base backup time, to avoid overlapping with any other external operations happening at this time.

          If not provided, full backups will be performed each day at 05:00 UTC

          Based on this parameter, an automatic retention policy is defined to delete old base backups.
          This parameter specifies the number of base backups to keep, in a sliding window.
          Consequently, the time range covered by backups is `periodicity*retention`, where `periodicity` is the separation between backups as specified by the `cronSchedule` property.

          Default is 5.

          ### `async` Mode

          When in asynchronous mode the cluster is allowed to lose some committed transactions.
           When the primary server fails or becomes unavailable for any other reason a sufficiently healthy standby
           will automatically be promoted to primary. Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby
           remain in a "forked timeline" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,
           but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).

          ### `sync` Mode

          When in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all
           transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior
           per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`
           values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This
           means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
           administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
           loss.

          Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
           standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
           the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
           back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
           makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.

          When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
           mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
           signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.

          ### `strict-sync` Mode

          When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
           synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
           standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
           transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
           synchronous replica comes up.

          **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
           transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
           replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
           visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.

          It is a best practice, on non-containerized environments, when running production workloads, to run each database server on a different server (virtual or physical), i.e., not to co-locate more than one database server per host.

    [StackGres](https://stackgres.io) is the **Stack** required for enterprise production Post**Gres**. A fully-featured platform to run Postgres on Kubernetes. Fully Open Source, StackGres supports both a declarative approach suitable for GitOps workflows and a complete Web Console for the best user experience.

    Built by [OnGres](https://ongres.com) ("**On** Post**Gres**"), StackGres requires little to no prior Postgres experience. StackGres can perform fully automated deployments; fully automated database operations ("Day 2 operations") and comes with advanced database tuning by default. Yet remaining highly customizable for Postgres expert DBAs.

    [StackGres features](https://stackgres.io/features/) include, among others:

    * **High Availability with automated failover**. StackGres relies on [Patroni](https://github.com/zalando/patroni), and its built-in and fully automatic.
    * **Integrated connection pooling**. Built-in, by default, like it should be for production workloads.
    * **Automatic backups with lifecycle policies**. Backup your clusters automatically to any object store. Apply retention policies. Restoration supports PITR.
    * **Advanced replication modes**, including async, sync and group replication. It also supports cascading replication and standby clusters on separate Kubernetes clusters for disaster recovery.
    * **More than 150 Postgres extensions**. The Postgres platform with [the largest number of extensions in the world](https://stackgres.io/extensions/). With new extensions added continuously.
    * **Observability**. Fully integrated with the Prometheus stack. Includes pre-defined, Postgres-specific dashboards and alerts.
    * **Fully-featured Web Console**. Perform any operation from the Web Console. Supports SSO, fine-grained RBAC and a REST API.
    * **Distributed Logs**. StackGres developed a mechanism to ship logs from all pods to a central log server, managed by StackGres, that store logs in Postgres. Query your logs with SQL or from the Web Console!
    * **Automated Day 2 Operations**. Minor and major version upgrades, container upgrades, controlled restart, vacuum, repack, even benchmarks!
    * **Expertly tuned by default**. From the creators of [CONF](https://postgresqlco.nf), StackGres pre-tunes your Postgres servers with more than 40 parameters tuned by default.
    * **100% Open Source**. No "premium version with advanced features", no production usage restrictions. Just Open Source.
    * **[24/7 Support](https://stackgres.io/pricing/) Available from OnGres**
