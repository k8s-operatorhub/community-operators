                  this means that failover of a StatefulSet pod is a manual operation.
                  \n By enabling Pod Fencing and setting the `storageos.com/fenced=true`
                  label on a Pod, StorageOS will enable automated Pod failover (by
                  killing the application Pod on the failed node) if the following
                  conditions exist: \n - Pod fencing has not been explicitly disabled.
                  - StorageOS has determined that the node the Pod is running on is
                  \  offline.  StorageOS uses Gossip and TCP checks and will retry
                  for 30   seconds.  At this point all volumes on the failed node
                  are marked   offline (irrespective of whether fencing is enabled)
                  and volume   failover starts. - The Pod has the label `storageos.com/fenced=true`
                  set. - The Pod has at least one StorageOS volume attached. - Each
                  StorageOS volume has at least 1 healthy replica. \n When Pod Fencing
                  is disabled, StorageOS will not perform any interaction with Kubernetes
                  when it detects that a node has gone offline. Additionally, the
                  Kubernetes permissions required for Fencing will not be added to
