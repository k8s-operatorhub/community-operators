                      SecurityListManagementMode configures how security lists are managed by the CCM.
                      If you choose to have security lists managed by the CCM, ensure you have setup the following additional OCI policy:
                      Allow dynamic-group [your dynamic group name] to manage security-lists in compartment [your compartment name]

                      "All" (default): Manage all required security list rules for load balancer services.
                      "Frontend":      Manage only security list rules for ingress to the load
                                       balancer. Requires that the user has setup a rule that
                                       allows inbound traffic to the appropriate ports for kube
                                       proxy health port, node port ranges, and health check port ranges.
                                       E.g. 10.82.0.0/16 30000-32000.
                      "None":          Disables all security list management. Requires that the
                                       user has setup a rule that allows inbound traffic to the
                                       appropriate ports for kube proxy health port, node port
                                       anges, and health check port ranges. E.g. 10.82.0.0/16 30000-32000.
                                       Additionally requires the user to mange rules to allow
                                       inbound traffic to load balancers.
