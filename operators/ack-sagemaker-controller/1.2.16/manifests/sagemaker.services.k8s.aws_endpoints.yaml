                     does not change any customer-specified values such as VPC config, KMS
                     encryption, model, instance type, or instance count.

                     * RollingBack: Endpoint fails to scale up or down or change its variant
                     weight and is in the process of rolling back to its previous configuration.
                     Once the rollback completes, endpoint returns to an InService status.
                     This transitional status only applies to an endpoint that has autoscaling
                     enabled and is undergoing variant weight or capacity changes as part of
                     an UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities.html)
                     call or when the UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities.html)
                     operation is called explicitly.

                     * InService: Endpoint is available to process incoming requests.

                     * Deleting: DeleteEndpoint (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteEndpoint.html)
                     is executing.

                     * Failed: Endpoint could not be created, updated, or re-scaled. Use the
                     FailureReason value returned by DescribeEndpoint (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpoint.html)
                     for information about the failure. DeleteEndpoint (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteEndpoint.html)
                     is the only operation that can be performed on a failed endpoint.

                     * UpdateRollbackFailed: Both the rolling deployment and auto-rollback
                     failed. Your endpoint is in service with a mix of the old and new endpoint
                     configurations. For information about how to remedy this issue and restore
                     the endpoint's status to InService, see Rolling Deployments (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails-rolling.html).
