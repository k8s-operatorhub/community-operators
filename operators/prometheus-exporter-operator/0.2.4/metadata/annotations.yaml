  # Adding com.redhat.openshift.versions programmatically
  # This annotation was added because was possible to identify that this distribution uses API(s),
  # which were removed in the k8s version 1.22 and OpenShift version OCP 4.9. Then, it will prevent the bundle from being distributed on 4.9.
  # Please, ensure that your project is no longer using these API(s) and that you start to
  # distribute solutions which is compatible with OpenShift 4.9.
  # For further information, see: https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-prod/discussions/138
