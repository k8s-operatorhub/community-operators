                  Add cost allocation tags to the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an overview,
                  see Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-tags.html)
                  in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.


                  When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:


                     * Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.


                     * Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as
                     character strings.


                     * Tags are case-sensitive.


                     * A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites
                     the existing tag.


                  For a full list of tag restrictions, see Quotas related to queues (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-limits.html#limits-queues)
                  in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.


                  To be able to tag a queue on creation, you must have the sqs:CreateQueue
                  and sqs:TagQueue permissions.


                  Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information,
                  see Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a username (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name)
