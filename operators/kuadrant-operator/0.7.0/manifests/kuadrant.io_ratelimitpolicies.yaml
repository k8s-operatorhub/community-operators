                                     2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                                        label must appear by itself as the first label.

                                    dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a
                                    domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`).


                                    Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a *label* must consist of lower case

                                              Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                              exact string match. (See
                                              https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).


                                              If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                              entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                              entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                              If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                              purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                              capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                              match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                              as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                              the Gateway API.


                                              Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                              themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                                    label must appear by itself as the first label.


                                Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating
                                dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a
                                domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`).


                                Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a *label* must consist of lower case

                                          If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                          entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                          entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                          case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered

                                          Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                          exact string match. (See
                                          https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).


                                          If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                          entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                          entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                          If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                          purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                          capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                          match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                          as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                          the Gateway API.


                                          Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                          themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                                    Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches
                                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:


                                     1. IPs are not allowed.
                                     2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                                        label must appear by itself as the first label.


                                    Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating
                                    dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a
                                    domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`).


                                    Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a *label* must consist of lower case

                                    character. No other punctuation is allowed.

                                          HTTPQueryParamMatch describes how to select a HTTP route by matching HTTP
                                          query parameters.

                                              Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                              exact string match. (See
                                              https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).


                                              If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                              entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                              entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                              If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                              purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                              capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                              match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                              as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                              the Gateway API.


                                              Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                              themselves against potential differences in the implementations.
