              FeatureGroupSpec defines the desired state of FeatureGroup.


              Amazon SageMaker Feature Store stores features in a collection called Feature
              Group. A Feature Group can be visualized as a table which has rows, with
              a unique identifier for each row where each column in the table is a feature.
              In principle, a Feature Group is composed of features and values per features.

              eventTimeFeatureName:
                description: |-
                  The name of the feature that stores the EventTime of a Record in a FeatureGroup.


                  An EventTime is a point in time when a new event occurs that corresponds
                  to the creation or update of a Record in a FeatureGroup. All Records in the
                  FeatureGroup must have a corresponding EventTime.


                  An EventTime can be a String or Fractional.


                     * Fractional: EventTime feature values must be a Unix timestamp in seconds.


                     * String: EventTime feature values must be an ISO-8601 string in the format.
                     The following formats are supported yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ and yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ
                     where yyyy, MM, and dd represent the year, month, and day respectively
                     and HH, mm, ss, and if applicable, SSS represent the hour, month, second
                     and milliseconds respsectively. 'T' and Z are constants.

                  FeatureNames cannot be any of the following: is_deleted, write_time, api_invocation_time


                  You can create up to 2,500 FeatureDefinitions per FeatureGroup.

                     * A configuration for an Amazon Web Services Glue or Amazon Web Services
                     Hive data catalog.


                     * An KMS encryption key to encrypt the Amazon S3 location used for OfflineStore.
                     If KMS encryption key is not specified, by default we encrypt all data
                     at rest using Amazon Web Services KMS key. By defining your bucket-level
                     key (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-key.html)
                     for SSE, you can reduce Amazon Web Services KMS requests costs by up to
                     99 percent.


                     * Format for the offline store table. Supported formats are Glue (Default)

                  reads and writes that your application performs on your feature group. You
                  do not need to specify read and write throughput because Feature Store accommodates
                  your workloads as they ramp up and down. You can switch a feature group to
                  on-demand only once in a 24 hour period. With provisioned throughput mode,
                  you specify the read and write capacity per second that you expect your application
                  to require, and you are billed based on those limits. Exceeding provisioned
