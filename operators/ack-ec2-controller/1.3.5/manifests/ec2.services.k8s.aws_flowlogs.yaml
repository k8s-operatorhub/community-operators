                  This parameter is required if the destination type is cloud-watch-logs, or
                  if the destination type is kinesis-data-firehose and the delivery stream
                  and the resources to monitor are in different accounts.

                  The destination for the flow log data. The meaning of this parameter depends
                  on the destination type.

                     * If the destination type is cloud-watch-logs, specify the ARN of a CloudWatch
                     Logs log group. For example: arn:aws:logs:region:account_id:log-group:my_group
                     Alternatively, use the LogGroupName parameter.

                     * If the destination type is s3, specify the ARN of an S3 bucket. For
                     example: arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/my_subfolder/ The subfolder is optional.
                     Note that you can't use AWSLogs as a subfolder name.

                     * If the destination type is kinesis-data-firehose, specify the ARN of
                     a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. For example: arn:aws:firehose:region:account_id:deliverystream:my_stream

                  The fields to include in the flow log record. List the fields in the order
                  in which they should appear. If you omit this parameter, the flow log is
                  created using the default format. If you specify this parameter, you must
                  include at least one field. For more information about the available fields,
                  see Flow log records (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html)

                  The name of a new or existing CloudWatch Logs log group where Amazon EC2
                  publishes your flow logs.

                  This parameter is valid only if the destination type is cloud-watch-logs.

              maxAggregationInterval:
                description: |-
                  The maximum interval of time during which a flow of packets is captured and
                  aggregated into a flow log record. The possible values are 60 seconds (1
                  minute) or 600 seconds (10 minutes). This parameter must be 60 seconds for
                  transit gateway resource types.

                  When a network interface is attached to a Nitro-based instance (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-nitro-instances.html),
