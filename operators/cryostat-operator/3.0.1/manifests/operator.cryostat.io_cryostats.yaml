                                              pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can

                                              * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                              * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                                done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                                list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                                match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                                request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                                of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                                matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                              * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                                the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                                or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                              Implementations are required to support all path types.

                                              pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can
                                              be one of the following values:
                                              * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                              * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                                done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                                list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                                match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                                request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                                of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                                matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                              * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                                the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                                or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                              Implementations are required to support all path types.

                                              pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can
                                              be one of the following values:
                                              * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                              * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                                done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                                list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                                match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                                request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                                of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                                matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                              * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                                the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                                or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                              Implementations are required to support all path types.

                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                              provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                              pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can
                                              be one of the following values:
                                              * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                              * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                                done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                                list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                                match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                                request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                                of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                                matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                              * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                                the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                                or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                              Implementations are required to support all path types.

                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty

                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
