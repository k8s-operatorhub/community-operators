                  and version 3 (MySQL 8.0-compatible), use the following command:

                  aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine aurora-mysql --query "DBEngineVersions[].EngineVersion"

                  You can supply either 5.7 or 8.0 to use the default engine version for Aurora
                  MySQL version 2 or version 3, respectively.

                     if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 Amazon Web
                     Services Region, then your ReplicationSourceIdentifier would look like
                     Example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1.

                  To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating
                  Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)
                  (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html)
                  and Signature Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

                  If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify
                  SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl
                  manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a
                  valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services
                  Region.

                description: |-
                  Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

                  When the DB cluster is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of
                  the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System (DNS)
                  endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within
                  the same VPC as the DB cluster, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address.
                  Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it
                  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to
                  the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

                  When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster
                  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                  Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnetGroupName

                  the following applies:

                     * If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway
                     attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

                     * If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached
                     to it, the DB cluster is public.

                  If DBSubnetGroupName is specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified,
                  the following applies:

                     * If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway
                     attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

                     * If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached

                  If you don't specify a RestoreType value, then the new DB cluster is restored

                  sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can
