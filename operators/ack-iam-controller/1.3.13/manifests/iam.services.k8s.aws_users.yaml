              UserSpec defines the desired state of User.

              This data type is used as a response element in the following operations:

                  The name of the user to create.

                  IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account.
                  Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources
                  named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

                  This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash

                  This parameter allows (through its regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex))
                  a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself
                  or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
                  can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character
                  (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased
                  letters.

                  The ARN of the managed policy that is used to set the permissions boundary
                  for the user.

                  A permissions boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that identity-based
                  policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions. Permissions
                  boundaries do not define the maximum permissions that a resource-based policy
                  can grant to an entity. To learn more, see Permissions boundaries for IAM

                  topic in the IAM User Guide. If a password is used more than once in a five-minute
                  span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null
                  (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password.
                  This can be because:

                     * The user never had a password.

                     * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this
                     information on October 20, 2014.

                  A null value does not mean that the user never had a password. Also, if the
                  user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this
                  field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

                  This value is returned only in the GetUser and ListUsers operations.
