                                  Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline.

                                  A patch filter consists of a key and a set of values. The filter key is a
                                  patch property. For example, the available filter keys for WINDOWS are PATCH_SET,
                                  PRODUCT, PRODUCT_FAMILY, CLASSIFICATION, and MSRC_SEVERITY.

                                  The filter values define a matching criterion for the patch property indicated
                                  by the key. For example, if the filter key is PRODUCT and the filter values
                                  are ["Office 2013", "Office 2016"], then the filter accepts all patches where
                                  product name is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The filter values
                                  can be exact values for the patch property given as a key, or a wildcard
                                  (*), which matches all values.

                                  You can view lists of valid values for the patch properties by running the
                                  DescribePatchProperties command. For information about which patch properties
                                  can be used with each major operating system, see DescribePatchProperties.

                  ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY

                  Linux and macOS: A package in the rejected patches list is installed only
                  if it is a dependency of another package. It is considered compliant with
                  the patch baseline, and its status is reported as INSTALLED_OTHER. This is
                  the default action if no option is specified.

                  Windows Server: Windows Server doesn't support the concept of package dependencies.
                  If a package in the rejected patches list and already installed on the node,
                  its status is reported as INSTALLED_OTHER. Any package not already installed
                  on the node is skipped. This is the default action if no option is specified.

                  BLOCK

                  All OSs: Packages in the rejected patches list, and packages that include
                  them as dependencies, aren't installed by Patch Manager under any circumstances.
                  If a package was installed before it was added to the rejected patches list,
                  or is installed outside of Patch Manager afterward, it's considered noncompliant
                  with the patch baseline and its status is reported as INSTALLED_REJECTED.

                     * Key=OS,Value=Windows
