                  Key-value pairs to specify advanced configuration options. The following
                  key-value pairs are supported:


                     * "rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index": "true" | "false" - Note the
                     use of a string rather than a boolean. Specifies whether explicit references
                     to indexes are allowed inside the body of HTTP requests. If you want to
                     configure access policies for domain sub-resources, such as specific indexes
                     and domain APIs, you must disable this property. Default is true.


                     * "indices.fielddata.cache.size": "80" - Note the use of a string rather
                     than a boolean. Specifies the percentage of heap space allocated to field
                     data. Default is unbounded.


                     * "indices.query.bool.max_clause_count": "1024" - Note the use of a string
                     rather than a boolean. Specifies the maximum number of clauses allowed
                     in a Lucene boolean query. Default is 1,024. Queries with more than the
                     permitted number of clauses result in a TooManyClauses error.


                     * "override_main_response_version": "true" | "false" - Note the use of
                     a string rather than a boolean. Specifies whether the domain reports its
                     version as 7.10 to allow Elasticsearch OSS clients and plugins to continue
                     working with it. Default is false when creating a domain and true when
                     upgrading a domain.
