                    an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in a capacity provider strategy.
                    The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider
                    with a cluster.


                    If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity
                    provider must already be created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers
                    can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

                      last working deployment.


                      When the alarms are generated, Amazon ECS sets the service deployment to
                      failed. Set the rollback parameter to have Amazon ECS to roll back your service
                      to the last completed deployment after a failure.


                      You can only use the DeploymentAlarms method to detect failures when the

                      The deployment circuit breaker determines whether a service deployment will
                      fail if the service can't reach a steady state. If it is turned on, a service

              healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds:

                  The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores
                  unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first
                  started. This is only used when your service is configured to use a load
                  balancer. If your service has a load balancer defined and you don't specify
                  a health check grace period value, the default value of 0 is used.


                  If you do not use an Elastic Load Balancing, we recommend that you use the
                  startPeriod in the task definition health check parameters. For more information,
                  see Health check (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheck.html).


                  If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load
                  Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up
                  to 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 69 years). During that time, the Amazon ECS
                  service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent
                  the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before
                  they have time to come up.

                  in the Amazon ECS User Guide for Fargate.


                  The EC2 launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered to
                  your cluster.


                  The EXTERNAL launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises server or virtual
                  machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.


                  A service can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy. If
                  a launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy parameter must be

                  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.


                  If the service uses the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller and using
                  either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you must specify
                  one or more target group ARNs to attach to the service. The service-linked
                  role is required for services that use multiple target groups. For more information,
                  see Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html)
                  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.


                  If the service uses the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the service is
                  required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer.
                  When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups
                  (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, CodeDeploy determines
                  which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY, and it associates
                  one target group with it. Then, it also associates the other target group
                  with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two
                  listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener
                  that you can use to perform validation tests with Lambda functions before
                  routing production traffic to it.


                  If you use the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, these values can be changed
                  when updating the service.


                  For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must
                  contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name, and the container
                  port to access from the load balancer. The container name must be as it appears
                  in a container definition. The load balancer name parameter must be omitted.
                  When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container
                  instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group
                  that's specified here.


                  For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name,
                  the container name , and the container port to access from the load balancer.
                  The container name must be as it appears in a container definition. The target
                  group ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed
                  on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load
                  balancer that's specified here.


                  Services with tasks that use the awsvpc network mode (for example, those
                  with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and
                  Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers aren't supported. Also, when
                  you create any target groups for these services, you must choose ip as the
                  target type, not instance. This is because tasks that use the awsvpc network
                  mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2
                  instance.

                    When you add, update, or remove a load balancer configuration, Amazon ECS
                    starts a new deployment with the updated Elastic Load Balancing configuration.
                    This causes tasks to register to and deregister from load balancers.


                    We recommend that you verify this on a test environment before you update
                    the Elastic Load Balancing configuration.

                  only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your service and your
                  task definition doesn't use the awsvpc network mode. If you specify the role
                  parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the loadBalancers
                  parameter.


                  If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that
                  role is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked
                  role is required if your task definition uses the awsvpc network mode or
                  if the service is configured to use service discovery, an external deployment
                  controller, multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in
                  which case you don't specify a role here. For more information, see Using
                  service-linked roles for Amazon ECS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html)

                  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify
                  the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the
                  path. For example, if a role with the name bar has a path of /foo/ then you

                  There are two service scheduler strategies available:


                     * REPLICA-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired
                     number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler
                     spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies
                     and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler
                     strategy is required if the service uses the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment
                     controller types.


                     * DAEMON-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each
                     active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints
                     that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates
                     the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that
                     don't meet the placement constraints. When you're using this strategy,
                     you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement
                     strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. Tasks using the Fargate
                     launch type or the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types
                     don't support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.

              serviceConnectConfiguration:

                  The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and
                  be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a namespace.


                  Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services
                  in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters
                  in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects
                  logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS
                  services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information,
                  see Service Connect (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)

                    description: |-
                      The log configuration for the container. This parameter maps to LogConfig
                      in the Create a container (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate)
                      section of the Docker Remote API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/)
                      and the --log-driver option to docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).


                      By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon
                      uses. However, the container might use a different logging driver than the
                      Docker daemon by specifying a log driver configuration in the container definition.
                      For more information about the options for different supported log drivers,
                      see Configure logging drivers (https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/)
                      in the Docker documentation.


                      Understand the following when specifying a log configuration for your containers.


                         * Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available
                         to the Docker daemon. Additional log drivers may be available in future
                         releases of the Amazon ECS container agent. For tasks on Fargate, the
                         supported log drivers are awslogs, splunk, and awsfirelens. For tasks
                         hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are awslogs,
                         fluentd, gelf, json-file, journald, logentries,syslog, splunk, and awsfirelens.


                         * This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater
                         on your container instance.


                         * For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container
                         agent must register the available logging drivers with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS
                         environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use
                         these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS
                         container agent configuration (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html)
                         in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.


                         * For tasks that are on Fargate, because you don't have access to the
                         underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional software
                         needed must be installed outside of the task. For example, the Fluentd
                         output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send Gelf logs
                         to.

                            be exposed to a container in the following ways:


                               * To inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables,
                               use the secrets container definition parameter.


                               * To reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container,
                               use the secretOptions container definition parameter.

                          The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy
                          can be set when using the RunTask or CreateCluster APIs or as the default
                          capacity provider strategy for a cluster with the CreateCluster API.


                          Only capacity providers that are already associated with a cluster and have
                          an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in a capacity provider strategy.
                          The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider
                          with a cluster.


                          If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity
                          provider must already be created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers
                          can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.


                          To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT
                          capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts
                          and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider
                          strategy.


                          A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 capacity providers.

                        Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services
                        in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters

                        logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS
                        services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information,

                            and the --log-driver option to docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).


                            By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon
                            uses. However, the container might use a different logging driver than the
                            Docker daemon by specifying a log driver configuration in the container definition.
                            For more information about the options for different supported log drivers,
                            see Configure logging drivers (https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/)
                            in the Docker documentation.


                            Understand the following when specifying a log configuration for your containers.


                               * Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available
                               to the Docker daemon. Additional log drivers may be available in future
                               releases of the Amazon ECS container agent. For tasks on Fargate, the
                               supported log drivers are awslogs, splunk, and awsfirelens. For tasks
                               hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are awslogs,
                               fluentd, gelf, json-file, journald, logentries,syslog, splunk, and awsfirelens.


                               * This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater
                               on your container instance.


                               * For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container
                               agent must register the available logging drivers with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS
                               environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use
                               these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS
                               container agent configuration (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html)
                               in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.


                               * For tasks that are on Fargate, because you don't have access to the
                               underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional software
                               needed must be installed outside of the task. For example, the Fluentd
                               output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send Gelf logs
                               to.

                                          them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define them.


                                          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:


                                             * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50


                                             * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
                                             have only one value.


                                             * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8


                                             * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8


                                             * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
                                             remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
                                             Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable
                                             in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.


                                             * Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.


                                             * Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such
                                             as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web

                          can be set when using the RunTask or CreateCluster APIs or as the default
                          capacity provider strategy for a cluster with the CreateCluster API.


                          Only capacity providers that are already associated with a cluster and have
                          an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in a capacity provider strategy.
                          The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider
                          with a cluster.


                          If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity
                          provider must already be created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers
                          can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.


                          To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT
                          capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts
                          and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider
                          strategy.


                          A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 capacity providers.

                          When you add, update, or remove a load balancer configuration, Amazon ECS
                          starts a new deployment with the updated Elastic Load Balancing configuration.
                          This causes tasks to register to and deregister from load balancers.


                          We recommend that you verify this on a test environment before you update
                          the Elastic Load Balancing configuration.


                          A service-linked role is required for services that use multiple target groups.
                          For more information, see Using service-linked roles (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html)

                          The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize and organize
                          them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define them.


                          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:


                             * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50


                             * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
                             have only one value.


                             * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8


                             * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8


                             * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
                             remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
                             Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable
                             in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.


                             * Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.


                             * Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such
                             as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web
                             Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                             Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
