                  255 Unicode characters in UTF-8 \n * Tag keys and values are case
                  sensitive. \n * Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or

                  use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix.
                  Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret
