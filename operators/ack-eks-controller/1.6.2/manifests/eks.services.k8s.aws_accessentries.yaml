              AccessEntrySpec defines the desired state of AccessEntry.

              An access entry allows an IAM principal (user or role) to access your cluster.
              Access entries can replace the need to maintain the aws-auth ConfigMap for
              authentication. For more information about access entries, see Access entries
              (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html) in
              the Amazon EKS User Guide.
