                        A URI consists of the following components: protocol://hostname:port/path?query.
                        You must modify at least one of the following components to avoid a redirect
                        loop: protocol, hostname, port, or path. Any components that you do not modify
                        retain their original values.


                        You can reuse URI components using the following reserved keywords:


                           * #{protocol}


                           * #{host}

                           * #{query}


                        For example, you can change the path to "/new/#{path}", the hostname to "example.#{host}",
                        or the query to "#{query}&value=xyz".
