                  as the root directory of your file system to NFS clients using the access
                  point. The clients using the access point can only access the root directory
                  and below. If the RootDirectory > Path specified does not exist, Amazon EFS
                  creates it and applies the CreationInfo settings when a client connects to
                  an access point. When specifying a RootDirectory, you must provide the Path,
                  and the CreationInfo.

                  Amazon EFS creates a root directory only if you have provided the CreationInfo:
                  OwnUid, OwnGID, and permissions for the directory. If you do not provide
                  this information, Amazon EFS does not create the root directory. If the root
                  directory does not exist, attempts to mount using the access point will fail.

                      > Path. If the access point root directory does not exist, EFS creates it
                      with these settings when a client connects to the access point. When specifying
                      CreationInfo, you must include values for all properties.

                      Amazon EFS creates a root directory only if you have provided the CreationInfo:
                      OwnUid, OwnGID, and permissions for the directory. If you do not provide
                      this information, Amazon EFS does not create the root directory. If the root
                      directory does not exist, attempts to mount using the access point will fail.

                      If you do not provide CreationInfo and the specified RootDirectory does not
                      exist, attempts to mount the file system using the access point will fail.
