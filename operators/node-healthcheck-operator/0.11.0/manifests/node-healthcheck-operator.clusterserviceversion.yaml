          EscalatingRemediations contain a list of ordered remediation templates with a timeout.
          The remediation templates will be used one after another, until the unhealthy node
          gets healthy within the timeout of the currently processed remediation. The order of
          remediation is defined by the "order" field of each "escalatingRemediation".

          RemediationTemplate is a reference to a remediation template

          Timeout defines how long NHC will wait for the node getting healthy
          before the next remediation (if any) will be used. When the last remediation times out,
          the overall remediation is considered as failed.
          As a safeguard for preventing parallel remediations, a minimum of 60s is enforced.


          Expects a string of decimal numbers each with optional
          fraction and a unit suffix, eg "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m".

          HealthyDelay is the time before NHC would allow a node to be healthy again.

          Remediation is allowed if no more than "MaxUnhealthy" nodes selected by "selector" are not healthy.

          Percentage values must be positive whole numbers and are capped at 100%.
          0% is valid and will block all remediation.
          MaxUnhealthy should not be used with remediators that delete nodes (e.g. MachineDeletionRemediation),
          as this breaks the logic for counting healthy and unhealthy nodes.
          MinHealthy and MaxUnhealthy are configuring the same aspect,

          Label selector to match nodes whose health will be exercised.


          Selecting both control-plane and worker nodes in one NHC CR is
          highly discouraged and can result in undesired behaviour.


          Note: mandatory now for above reason, but for backwards compatibility existing
          CRs will continue to work with an empty selector, which matches all nodes.

          StormCooldownDuration defines the duration of an optional cooldown phase after a storm.
          A "storm" happens when the number of (un)healthy nodes exceeds the threshold defined by minHealthy or maxUnhealthy.
          Sometimes this is triggered by a single root cause.
          When that cause is fixed, there is a risk to remediate healthy nodes:
          the async nature of node status updates would result in only some nodes being detected as healthy by NHC in a first round of updates,
          which results in minHealthy or maxUnhealthy threshold being fulfilled (the storm ends) and triggering unneeded new remediation.
          The storm cooldown phase will prevent creation of new remediation for the given duration by giving NHC some time to get the latest node statuses.


          Expects a string of decimal numbers each with optional fraction and a unit
          suffix, e.g. "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us"

    ### Introduction
    Hardware is imperfect, and software contains bugs. When node level failures such as kernel hangs or dead NICs
    occur, the work required from the cluster does not decrease - workloads from affected nodes need to be
    restarted somewhere.

    However some workloads, such as RWO volumes and StatefulSets, may require at-most-one semantics.
    Failures affecting these kind of workloads risk data loss and/or corruption if nodes (and the workloads
    running on them) are assumed to be dead whenever we stop hearing from them. For this reason it is important
    to know that the node has reached a safe state before initiating recovery of the workload.

    Unfortunately it is not always practical to require admin intervention in order to confirm the node’s true status.
    In order to automate the recovery of exclusive workloads, we provide operators for failure detection
    and remediation.

    ### Failure detection: Node Health Check operator
    The “Node Health Check” (NHC) operator checks each Node’s set of
    NodeConditions (eg. NotReady) against the criteria and thresholds defined in
    NodeHealthCheck configuration. If the Node is deemed to be in a failed
    state, NHC will initiate recovery by using the SIG Cluster API's “External
    Remediation” API to instantiate the configured remediation template which
    specifies the mechanism/controller to be used.

    ### Failure handling: External remediators
    There are multiple remediators for handling node failure that we recommend:
    - Self Node Remediation (SNR)
    - Fence Agents Remediation (FAR)
    - Machine Deletion Remediation (MDR)

    #### Self Node Remediation (SNR)
    SNR uses watchdog timers and heuristics to ensure nodes enter a safe state
    (no longer hosting workloads) within a known and finite period of time,
    before signaling to the system that all Pods on the failed Node are no longer active
    and can be relocated elsewhere.
    In the case of transient errors, the watchdog’s actions will also result in
    the node rebooting and rejoining the cluster - restoring capacity.

    #### Fence Agents Remediation (FAR)
    FAR uses well-known agents to fence unhealthy nodes, and eventually FAR remediates the nodes.
    The remediation includes rebooting the unhealthy node using a fence agent,
    and then evicting workloads from the unhealthy node.

    #### Machine Deletion Remediation (MDR)
    MDR is limited to OpenShift, and it uses Machine API for reprovisioning unhealthy nodes by deleting their machines.
