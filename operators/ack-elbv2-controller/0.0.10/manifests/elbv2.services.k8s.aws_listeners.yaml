                        A URI consists of the following components: protocol://hostname:port/path?query.

                        loop: protocol, hostname, port, or path. Any components that you do not modify
                        retain their original values.


                        You can reuse URI components using the following reserved keywords:

                        For example, you can change the path to "/new/#{path}", the hostname to "example.#{host}",
                        or the query to "#{query}&value=xyz".

                  All CRs managed by ACK have a common `Status.ACKResourceMetadata` member
                  that is used to contain resource sync state, account ownership,
                  constructed ARN for the resource
                properties:

                    description: |-
                      ARN is the Amazon Resource Name for the resource. This is a
                      globally-unique identifier and is set only by the ACK service controller
                      once the controller has orchestrated the creation of the resource OR
                      when it has verified that an "adopted" resource (a resource where the
                      ARN annotation was set by the Kubernetes user on the CR) exists and
                      matches the supplied CR's Spec field values.
