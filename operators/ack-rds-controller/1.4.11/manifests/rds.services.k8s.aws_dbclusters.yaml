              For an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, this data type is used as a response element
              in the operations CreateDBCluster, DeleteDBCluster, DescribeDBClusters, FailoverDBCluster,
              ModifyDBCluster, PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster, RestoreDBClusterFromS3, RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot,
              RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime, StartDBCluster, and StopDBCluster.

              For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response element in

              readerEndpoint:
                description: |-
                  The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster
                  load-balances connections across the Aurora Replicas that are available in
                  a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint,
                  Aurora distributes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the
                  DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across
                  multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

                  If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to is
                  promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue
                  sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can
                  then reconnect to the reader endpoint.
