                            Expanded path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted.
                            Behaves similarly to SubPath but environment variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment.
                            Defaults to "" (volume's root).
                            SubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive.
