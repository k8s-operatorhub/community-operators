                            kept in the application's revision history, which is used
                            for informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to
                            previous versions. This should only be changed in exceptional
                            circumstances. Setting to zero will store no history.
                            This will reduce storage used. Increasing will increase
                            the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend
                            increasing it. Default is 10.
