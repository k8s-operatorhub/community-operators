              IPSetSpec defines the desired state of IPSet.


              Contains zero or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses specified in
              Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. WAF supports all IPv4 and
              IPv6 CIDR ranges except for /0. For information about CIDR notation, see
              the Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).


              WAF assigns an ARN to each IPSet that you create. To use an IP set in a rule,
              you provide the ARN to the Rule statement IPSetReferenceStatement.

                  Contains an array of strings that specifies zero or more IP addresses or
                  blocks of IP addresses that you want WAF to inspect for in incoming requests.
                  All addresses must be specified using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
                  notation. WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except for /0.


                  Example address strings:


                     * For requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify
                     192.0.2.44/32.


                     * For requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255,
                     specify 192.0.2.0/24.


                     * For requests that originated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111,
                     specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128.


                     * For requests that originated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
                     to 1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64.

                  Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified
                  Access instance.


                  To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia)
                  as follows:


                     * CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: --scope=CLOUDFRONT
                     --region=us-east-1.


                     * API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

                    like billing or other management. Typically, the tag key represents a category,
                    such as "environment", and the tag value represents a specific value within
                    that category, such as "test," "development," or "production". Or you might
                    set the tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You
                    can specify one or more tags to add to each Amazon Web Services resource,
                    up to 50 tags for a resource.


                    You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources that you manage through WAF:
                    web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and regex pattern sets. You can't manage
                    or view tags through the WAF console.
