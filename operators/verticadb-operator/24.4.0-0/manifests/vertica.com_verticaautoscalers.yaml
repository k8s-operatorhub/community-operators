                  This defines how the scaling will happen.  This can be one of the following:
                  - Subcluster: Scaling will be achieved by creating or deleting entire subclusters.
                    The template for new subclusters are either the template if filled out
                    or an existing subcluster that matches the service name.
                  - Pod: Only increase or decrease the size of an existing subcluster.
                    If multiple subclusters are selected by the serviceName, this will grow
                    the last subcluster only.
                type: string
              serviceName:
                description: |-
                  This acts as a selector for the subclusters that are being scaled together.
                  Each subcluster has a service name field, which if omitted is the same
                  name as the subcluster name.  Multiple subclusters that have the same
                  service name use the same service object.
                type: string
              targetSize:
                description: |-
                  This is the total pod count for all subclusters that match the
                  serviceName.  Changing this value may trigger a change in the
                  VerticaDB that is associated with this object.  This value is generally
                  left as zero.  It will get initialized in the operator and then modified
                  via the /scale subresource.

                type: integer
              template:
                description: |-
                  When the scaling granularity is Subcluster, this field defines a template
                  to use for when a new subcluster needs to be created.  If size is 0, then
                  the operator will use an existing subcluster to use as the template.  If
                  size is > 0, the service name must match the serviceName parameter.  The
                  name of the new subcluster is always auto generated.  If the name is set
                  here it will be used as a prefix for the new subcluster.  Otherwise, we
                  use the name of this VerticaAutoscaler object as a prefix for all
                  subclusters.

                      This defines the resource requests and limits for pods in the subcluster.
                      It is advisable that the request and limits match as this ensures the
                      pods are assigned to the guaranteed QoS class. This will reduces the
                      chance that pods are chosen by the OOM killer.

                      either delete or schedule new pods.


                      The database has a k-safety of 1. So, if this is a primary subcluster,
                      the minimum value is 3. If this is a secondary subcluster, the minimum is
                      0.


                      Note, you must have a valid license to pick a value larger than 3. The
                      default license that comes in the vertica container is for the community
                      edition, which can only have 3 nodes. The license can be set with the
                      db.licenseSecret parameter.
