                          Pipe mode

                          If an algorithm supports Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly
                          from Amazon S3 to the container.

                          File mode

                          If an algorithm supports File mode, SageMaker downloads the training data
                          from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and mounts the directory to
                          the Docker volume for the training container.

                          You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to accommodate
                          the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training data, the ML storage
                          volume also stores the output model. The algorithm container uses the ML
                          storage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.

                          For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly. Your
                          training duration is predictable if the input data objects sizes are approximately
                          the same. SageMaker does not split the files any further for model training.
                          If the object sizes are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data distribution
                          is also skewed when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming
                          a bottleneck in training.

                          FastFile mode

                          If an algorithm supports FastFile mode, SageMaker streams data directly from
                          S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides file system access
                          to the data. Users can author their training script to interact with these
                          files as if they were stored on disk.

                          FastFile mode works best when the data is read sequentially. Augmented manifest
                          files aren't supported. The startup time is lower when there are fewer files
                          in the S3 bucket provided.

                            Pipe mode

                            If an algorithm supports Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly
                            from Amazon S3 to the container.

                            File mode

                            If an algorithm supports File mode, SageMaker downloads the training data
                            from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and mounts the directory to
                            the Docker volume for the training container.

                            You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to accommodate
                            the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training data, the ML storage
                            volume also stores the output model. The algorithm container uses the ML
                            storage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.

                            For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly. Your
                            training duration is predictable if the input data objects sizes are approximately
                            the same. SageMaker does not split the files any further for model training.
                            If the object sizes are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data distribution
                            is also skewed when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming
                            a bottleneck in training.

                            FastFile mode

                            If an algorithm supports FastFile mode, SageMaker streams data directly from
                            S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides file system access
                            to the data. Users can author their training script to interact with these

                            A configuration for a shuffle option for input data in a channel. If you
                            use S3Prefix for S3DataType, the results of the S3 key prefix matches are
                            shuffled. If you use ManifestFile, the order of the S3 object references
                            in the ManifestFile is shuffled. If you use AugmentedManifestFile, the order
                            of the JSON lines in the AugmentedManifestFile is shuffled. The shuffling
                            order is determined using the Seed value.

                            For Pipe input mode, when ShuffleConfig is specified shuffling is done at
                            the start of every epoch. With large datasets, this ensures that the order
                            of the training data is different for each epoch, and it helps reduce bias
                            and possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job when ShuffleConfig
                            is combined with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key, the data is shuffled
                            across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch
                            might be sent to a different node on the second epoch.

                      Specifies a limit to how long a job can run. When the job reaches the time
                      limit, SageMaker ends the job. Use this API to cap costs.

                      To stop a training job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal,
                      which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second
                      window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost.

                      The training algorithms provided by SageMaker automatically save the intermediate
                      results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts
                      is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it
                      can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might
                      not be ready to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model
                      artifact. You can use it to create a model with CreateModel.

                      The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate
                      model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is
                      sufficient for the training job to complete.

                            about input modes, see Algorithms (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html).

                            Pipe mode

                            If an algorithm supports Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly
                            from Amazon S3 to the container.

                            File mode

                            If an algorithm supports File mode, SageMaker downloads the training data
                            from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and mounts the directory to
                            the Docker volume for the training container.

                            You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to accommodate
                            the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training data, the ML storage
                            volume also stores the output model. The algorithm container uses the ML
                            storage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.

                            For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly. Your
                            training duration is predictable if the input data objects sizes are approximately
                            the same. SageMaker does not split the files any further for model training.
                            If the object sizes are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data distribution
                            is also skewed when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming
                            a bottleneck in training.

                            FastFile mode

                            If an algorithm supports FastFile mode, SageMaker streams data directly from
                            S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides file system access
                            to the data. Users can author their training script to interact with these
                            files as if they were stored on disk.

                            FastFile mode works best when the data is read sequentially. Augmented manifest
                            files aren't supported. The startup time is lower when there are fewer files
                            in the S3 bucket provided.

                              about input modes, see Algorithms (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html).

                              Pipe mode

                              If an algorithm supports Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly
                              from Amazon S3 to the container.

                              File mode

                              If an algorithm supports File mode, SageMaker downloads the training data
                              from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and mounts the directory to
                              the Docker volume for the training container.

                              You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to accommodate
                              the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training data, the ML storage
                              volume also stores the output model. The algorithm container uses the ML
                              storage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.

                              For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly. Your
                              training duration is predictable if the input data objects sizes are approximately
                              the same. SageMaker does not split the files any further for model training.
                              If the object sizes are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data distribution
                              is also skewed when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming
                              a bottleneck in training.

                              FastFile mode

                              If an algorithm supports FastFile mode, SageMaker streams data directly from
                              S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides file system access
                              to the data. Users can author their training script to interact with these
                              files as if they were stored on disk.

                              FastFile mode works best when the data is read sequentially. Augmented manifest
                              files aren't supported. The startup time is lower when there are fewer files
                              in the S3 bucket provided.

                              A configuration for a shuffle option for input data in a channel. If you
                              use S3Prefix for S3DataType, the results of the S3 key prefix matches are
                              shuffled. If you use ManifestFile, the order of the S3 object references
                              in the ManifestFile is shuffled. If you use AugmentedManifestFile, the order
                              of the JSON lines in the AugmentedManifestFile is shuffled. The shuffling
                              order is determined using the Seed value.

                              For Pipe input mode, when ShuffleConfig is specified shuffling is done at
                              the start of every epoch. With large datasets, this ensures that the order
                              of the training data is different for each epoch, and it helps reduce bias
                              and possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job when ShuffleConfig
                              is combined with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key, the data is shuffled
                              across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch
                              might be sent to a different node on the second epoch.

                        limit, SageMaker ends the job. Use this API to cap costs.

                        To stop a training job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal,
                        which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second
                        window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost.

                        The training algorithms provided by SageMaker automatically save the intermediate
                        results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts
                        is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it
                        can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might
                        not be ready to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model
                        artifact. You can use it to create a model with CreateModel.

                        The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate
                        model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is
                        sufficient for the training job to complete.

                  over in the new tuning job.

                  All training jobs launched by the new hyperparameter tuning job are evaluated
                  by using the objective metric. If you specify IDENTICAL_DATA_AND_ALGORITHM
                  as the WarmStartType value for the warm start configuration, the training
                  job that performs the best in the new tuning job is compared to the best
                  training jobs from the parent tuning jobs. From these, the training job that
                  performs the best as measured by the objective metric is returned as the
                  overall best training job.

                  All training jobs launched by parent hyperparameter tuning jobs and the new
                  hyperparameter tuning jobs count against the limit of training jobs for the
                  tuning job.
