                  resources, of the specified resource type, that have one or more of the specified
                  tag key and value pairs are retained. If a resource is deleted, but it does
                  not have any of the specified tag key and value pairs, it is immediately
                  deleted without being retained by the retention rule.


                  You can add the same tag key and value pair to a maximum or five retention
                  rules.

                  deleted resources of the specified resource type in the Region in which the
                  rule is created, even if the resources are not tagged.
