                      * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
                      If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
                      it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
                      When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
                      and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
                      If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                      provisioner.
                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.
                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                    description: |-
                      Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                      The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                      a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                      Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                      If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                      value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                      Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                      the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                      This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                      Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
