                          Current implementation considers healthy pods, as pods that

                          \n Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If

                          which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy. \n IfHealthyBudget
                          policy means that running pods (status.phase=\"Running\"),
                          but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application
                          is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal
                          to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject
                          to the PDB for eviction. \n AlwaysAllow policy means that
                          all running pods (status.phase=\"Running\"), but not yet
                          healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                          of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective
                          running pods of a disrupted application might not get a
                          chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to
                          the PDB for eviction. \n Additional policies may be added
                          in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should
                          disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an
                          unrecognized policy in this field. \n This field is alpha-level.

                          for when unhealthy pods should be considered for eviction.
                          Current implementation considers healthy pods, as pods that
                          have status.conditions item with type=\"Ready\",status=\"True\".
                          \n Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If
                          no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                          which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy. \n IfHealthyBudget
                          policy means that running pods (status.phase=\"Running\"),
                          but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application
                          is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal
                          to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject
                          to the PDB for eviction. \n AlwaysAllow policy means that
                          all running pods (status.phase=\"Running\"), but not yet
                          healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                          of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective
                          running pods of a disrupted application might not get a
                          chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to
                          the PDB for eviction. \n Additional policies may be added
                          in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should
                          disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an
                          unrecognized policy in this field. \n This field is alpha-level.

                            treats \"global minimum\" as 0, and then the calculation
                            of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible

                            than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less
                            than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew

                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3

                          \n Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If

                          which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy. \n IfHealthyBudget
                          policy means that running pods (status.phase=\"Running\"),
                          but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application
                          is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal
                          to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject
                          to the PDB for eviction. \n AlwaysAllow policy means that
                          all running pods (status.phase=\"Running\"), but not yet
                          healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                          of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective
                          running pods of a disrupted application might not get a
                          chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to
                          the PDB for eviction. \n Additional policies may be added
                          in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should
                          disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an
                          unrecognized policy in this field. \n This field is alpha-level.

                          Current implementation considers healthy pods, as pods that
                          have status.conditions item with type=\"Ready\",status=\"True\".
                          \n Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If
                          no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                          which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy. \n IfHealthyBudget
                          policy means that running pods (status.phase=\"Running\"),
                          but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application
                          is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal
                          to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject
                          to the PDB for eviction. \n AlwaysAllow policy means that
                          all running pods (status.phase=\"Running\"), but not yet
                          healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                          of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective
                          running pods of a disrupted application might not get a
                          chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to
                          the PDB for eviction. \n Additional policies may be added
                          in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should
                          disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an
                          unrecognized policy in this field. \n This field is alpha-level.

                            topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread
                            treats \"global minimum\" as 0, and then the calculation
                            of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible
                            domains with matching topology keys equals or greater
                            than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less
                            than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew

                            must be DoNotSchedule. \n For example, in a 3-zone cluster,
                            MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with
                            the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2
                            | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains
                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3
                            - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field and requires
