                          The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container
                          can contain multiple dependencies. When a dependency is defined for container

                          Your Amazon ECS container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the
                          container agent to use container dependencies. However, we recommend using
                          the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent
                          version and updating to the latest version, see Updating the Amazon ECS Container
                          Agent (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html)
                          in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If you're using
                          an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1
                          of the ecs-init package. If your container instances are launched from version
                          20190301 or later, then they contain the required versions of the container
                          agent and ecs-init. For more information, see Amazon ECS-optimized Linux
                          AMI (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html)
                          in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.


                          For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires
                          the following platforms:


                             * Linux platform version 1.3.0 or later.


                             * Windows platform version 1.0.0 or later.

                          You can specify up to ten environment files. The file must have a .env file
                          extension. Each line in an environment file should contain an environment
                          variable in VARIABLE=VALUE format. Lines beginning with # are treated as
                          comments and are ignored.


                          If there are environment variables specified using the environment parameter
                          in a container definition, they take precedence over the variables contained
                          within an environment file. If multiple environment files are specified that
                          contain the same variable, they're processed from the top down. We recommend
                          that you use unique variable names. For more information, see Specifying
                          environment variables (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/taskdef-envfiles.html)

                          Consider the following when using the Fargate launch type:


                             * The file is handled like a native Docker env-file.


                             * There is no support for shell escape handling.


                             * The container entry point interperts the VARIABLE values.

                        An object representing a container health check. Health check parameters
                        that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks
                        that exist in the container image (such as those specified in a parent image
                        or from the image's Dockerfile). This configuration maps to the HEALTHCHECK
                        parameter of docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).


                        The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks
                        specified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health
                        checks that are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container
                        definition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition
                        override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.


                        You can view the health status of both individual containers and a task with
                        the DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in the console.


                        The health check is designed to make sure that your containers survive agent
                        restarts, upgrades, or temporary unavailability.


                        The following describes the possible healthStatus values for a container:


                           * HEALTHY-The container health check has passed successfully.


                           * UNHEALTHY-The container health check has failed.


                           * UNKNOWN-The container health check is being evaluated, there's no container
                           health check defined, or Amazon ECS doesn't have the health status of
                           the container.


                        The following describes the possible healthStatus values based on the container
                        health checker status of essential containers in the task with the following
                        priority order (high to low):


                           * UNHEALTHY-One or more essential containers have failed their health
                           check.


                           * UNKNOWN-Any essential container running within the task is in an UNKNOWN
                           state and no other essential containers have an UNHEALTHY state.


                           * HEALTHY-All essential containers within the task have passed their health
                           checks.


                        Consider the following task health example with 2 containers.


                           * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, the task health
                           is UNHEALTHY.


                           * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY, the task health
                           is UNHEALTHY.


                           * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, the task health
                           is UNKNOWN.


                           * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY, the task health
                           is HEALTHY.


                        Consider the following task health example with 3 containers.


                           * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, and Container3
                           is UNKNOWN, the task health is UNHEALTHY.


                           * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, and Container3
                           is HEALTHY, the task health is UNHEALTHY.


                           * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY, and Container3
                           is HEALTHY, the task health is UNHEALTHY.


                           * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, and Container3 is
                           HEALTHY, the task health is UNKNOWN.


                           * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, and Container3 is
                           UNKNOWN, the task health is UNKNOWN.


                           * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY, and Container3 is
                           HEALTHY, the task health is HEALTHY.


                        If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue
                        its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of
                        a service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped
                        and the service scheduler will replace it.


                        The following are notes about container health check support:


                           * When the Amazon ECS agent cannot connect to the Amazon ECS service,
                           the service reports the container as UNHEALTHY.


                           * The health check statuses are the "last heard from" response from the
                           Amazon ECS agent. There are no assumptions made about the status of the
                           container health checks.


                           * Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon
                           ECS container agent. For more information, see Updating the Amazon ECS
                           container agent (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html).


                           * Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're using
                           platform version 1.1.0 or greater. For more information, see Fargate platform

                        The log configuration for the container. This parameter maps to LogConfig
                        in the Create a container (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate)
                        section of the Docker Remote API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/)
                        and the --log-driver option to docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).


                        By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon
                        uses. However, the container might use a different logging driver than the
                        Docker daemon by specifying a log driver configuration in the container definition.
                        For more information about the options for different supported log drivers,
                        see Configure logging drivers (https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/)
                        in the Docker documentation.


                        Understand the following when specifying a log configuration for your containers.


                           * Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available
                           to the Docker daemon. Additional log drivers may be available in future
                           releases of the Amazon ECS container agent. For tasks on Fargate, the
                           supported log drivers are awslogs, splunk, and awsfirelens. For tasks
                           hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are awslogs,
                           fluentd, gelf, json-file, journald, logentries,syslog, splunk, and awsfirelens.


                           * This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater
                           on your container instance.


                           * For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container
                           agent must register the available logging drivers with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS
                           environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use
                           these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS
                           container agent configuration (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html)
                           in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.


                           * For tasks that are on Fargate, because you don't have access to the
                           underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional software
                           needed must be installed outside of the task. For example, the Fluentd
                           output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send Gelf logs
                           to.

                              be exposed to a container in the following ways:


                                 * To inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables,
                                 use the secrets container definition parameter.


                                 * To reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container,
                                 use the secretOptions container definition parameter.

                          Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container instance
                          to send or receive traffic. Port mappings are specified as part of the container
                          definition.


                          If you use containers in a task with the awsvpc or host network mode, specify
                          the exposed ports using containerPort. The hostPort can be left blank or
                          it must be the same value as the containerPort.


                          Most fields of this parameter (containerPort, hostPort, protocol) maps to
                          PortBindings in the Create a container (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate)
                          section of the Docker Remote API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/)
                          and the --publish option to docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).
                          If the network mode of a task definition is set to host, host ports must
                          either be undefined or match the container port in the port mapping.


                          You can't expose the same container port for multiple protocols. If you attempt
                          this, an error is returned.


                          After a task reaches the RUNNING status, manual and automatic host and container
                          port assignments are visible in the networkBindings section of DescribeTasks
                          API responses.

                          A list of namespaced kernel parameters to set in the container. This parameter
                          maps to Sysctls in the Create a container (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate)
                          section of the Docker Remote API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/)
                          and the --sysctl option to docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
                          For example, you can configure net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time setting to maintain
                          longer lived connections.


                          We don't recommend that you specify network-related systemControls parameters
                          for multiple containers in a single task that also uses either the awsvpc
                          or host network mode. Doing this has the following disadvantages:


                             * For tasks that use the awsvpc network mode including Fargate, if you
                             set systemControls for any container, it applies to all containers in
                             the task. If you set different systemControls for multiple containers
                             in a single task, the container that's started last determines which systemControls
                             take effect.


                             * For tasks that use the host network mode, the network namespace systemControls
                             aren't supported.


                          If you're setting an IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in
                          the task, the following conditions apply to your system controls. For more
                          information, see IPC mode (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_definition_ipcmode).


                             * For tasks that use the host IPC mode, IPC namespace systemControls aren't
                             supported.


                             * For tasks that use the task IPC mode, IPC namespace systemControls values
                             apply to all containers within a task.

                          parameter which Fargate overrides. The nofile resource limit sets a restriction
                          on the number of open files that a container can use. The default nofile
                          soft limit is 1024 and the default hard limit is 65535.

                  For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the awsvpc network mode is required. For
                  Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Linux instances, any network mode can be used.
                  For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances, <default> or awsvpc
                  can be used. If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port
                  mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have
                  external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest
                  networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack
                  instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode.


                  With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped
                  directly to the corresponding host port (for the host network mode) or the
                  attached elastic network interface port (for the awsvpc network mode), so
                  you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.


                  When using the host network mode, you should not run containers using the
                  root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a non-root user.


                  If the network mode is awsvpc, the task is allocated an elastic network interface,
                  and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service
                  or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see Task Networking
                  (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)
                  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.


                  If the network mode is host, you cannot run multiple instantiations of the
                  same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used.


                  For more information, see Network settings (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings)
                  in the Docker run reference.

              pidMode:
                description: |-
                  The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values
                  are host or task. On Fargate for Linux containers, the only valid value is
                  task. For example, monitoring sidecars might need pidMode to access information
                  about other containers running in the same task.


                  If host is specified, all containers within the tasks that specified the
                  host PID mode on the same container instance share the same process namespace
                  with the host Amazon EC2 instance.


                  If task is specified, all containers within the specified task share the
                  same process namespace.


                  If no value is specified, the default is a private namespace for each container.
                  For more information, see PID settings (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#pid-settings---pid)
                  in the Docker run reference.


                  If the host PID mode is used, there's a heightened risk of undesired process
                  namespace exposure. For more information, see Docker security (https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/).

                  The container instance attributes required by your task. When an Amazon EC2
                  instance is registered to your cluster, the Amazon ECS container agent assigns
                  some standard attributes to the instance. You can apply custom attributes.
                  These are specified as key-value pairs using the Amazon ECS console or the
                  PutAttributes API. These attributes are used when determining task placement
                  for tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. For more information, see Attributes
