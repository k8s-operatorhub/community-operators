                                  For example, if autoscaling is configured with a memory consumption target of 100Mi,
                                  and scale-down and scale-up tolerances of 5% and 1% respectively, scaling will be
                                  triggered when the actual consumption falls below 95Mi or exceeds 101Mi.

                                  tolerance is the tolerance on the ratio between the current and desired
                                  metric value under which no updates are made to the desired number of
                                  replicas (e.g. 0.01 for 1%). Must be greater than or equal to zero. If not
                                  set, the default cluster-wide tolerance is applied (by default 10%).

                                  For example, if autoscaling is configured with a memory consumption target of 100Mi,
                                  and scale-down and scale-up tolerances of 5% and 1% respectively, scaling will be
                                  triggered when the actual consumption falls below 95Mi or exceeds 101Mi.

                                  This is an alpha field and requires enabling the HPAConfigurableTolerance
                                  feature gate.

                            RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                            recursively.

                            If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                            If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                            recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                            recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                            field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                            supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                            an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                            If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                            None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                            If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                            SubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive.
