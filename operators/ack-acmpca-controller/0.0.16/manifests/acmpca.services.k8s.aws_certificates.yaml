                  This parameter should not be confused with the SigningAlgorithm parameter

                  The specified signing algorithm family (RSA or ECDSA) must match the algorithm

                  Specifies a custom configuration template to use when issuing a certificate.
                  If this parameter is not provided, Amazon Web Services Private CA defaults
                  to the EndEntityCertificate/V1 template. For CA certificates, you should
                  choose the shortest path length that meets your needs. The path length is
                  indicated by the PathLenN portion of the ARN, where N is the CA depth (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaTerms.html#terms-cadepth).


                  Note: The CA depth configured on a subordinate CA certificate must not exceed
                  the limit set by its parents in the CA hierarchy.


                  For a list of TemplateArn values supported by Amazon Web Services Private
                  CA, see Understanding Certificate Templates (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/UsingTemplates.html).
                type: string
              validity:
                description: |-
                  Information describing the end of the validity period of the certificate.
                  This parameter sets the “Not After” date for the certificate.


                  Certificate validity is the period of time during which a certificate is
                  valid. Validity can be expressed as an explicit date and time when the certificate
                  expires, or as a span of time after issuance, stated in days, months, or
                  years. For more information, see Validity (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.5)
                  in RFC 5280.


                  This value is unaffected when ValidityNotBefore is also specified. For example,
                  if Validity is set to 20 days in the future, the certificate will expire
                  20 days from issuance time regardless of the ValidityNotBefore value.


                  The end of the validity period configured on a certificate must not exceed
                  the limit set on its parents in the CA hierarchy.

              validityNotBefore:
                description: |-
                  Information describing the start of the validity period of the certificate.
                  This parameter sets the “Not Before" date for the certificate.


                  By default, when issuing a certificate, Amazon Web Services Private CA sets
                  the "Not Before" date to the issuance time minus 60 minutes. This compensates
                  for clock inconsistencies across computer systems. The ValidityNotBefore
                  parameter can be used to customize the “Not Before” value.


                  Unlike the Validity parameter, the ValidityNotBefore parameter is optional.


                  The ValidityNotBefore value is expressed as an explicit date and time, using
                  the Validity type value ABSOLUTE. For more information, see Validity (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_Validity.html)
