                                  Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                                  Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                  Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                  tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                  TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be

                                  it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                  negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                  Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                                  If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                                      Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                                      Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                      Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                      tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                      TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                                      of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                                      it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                      negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                      Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                                      If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
