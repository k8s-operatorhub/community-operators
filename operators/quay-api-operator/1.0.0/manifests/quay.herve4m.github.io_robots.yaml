                  not start by a digit, and must be at least two characters long.
                  If you omit the namespace part in the name, then the resource uses
                  your personal namespace. You can create and delete robot accounts
                  in your personal namespace, but not in the personal namespace of
                  other users. The token you use in 'quayToken' determines the user
                  account you are using.

                  RetSecretRef is the secret resource that the Robot resource creates. This secret will store the data that the resource generates:

                  - name - Token name. From this name and the token, in 'token', you can construct a Docker configuration file that you can use to manage images in the container image registry. See DockerConfig#filter.
                  - token - Robot credential (token).
