                  API operation in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the

                  This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and
                  China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services
                  Regions.


                  This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB instance. Source
                  DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions
                  and China Amazon Web Services Regions.


                  You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica
                  from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't
                  specify PreSignedUrl when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the
                  same Amazon Web Services Region.


                  The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica
                  API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that
                  contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must
                  contain the following parameter values:


                     * DestinationRegion - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted
                     read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same
                     one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation is called that contains
                     this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance
                     in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance
                     in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica
                     operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned
                     URL that contains a call to the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation
                     in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the DestinationRegion
                     in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services
                     Region.


                     * KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the
                     read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the
                     same identifier for both the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation that
                     is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation
                     contained in the presigned URL.


                     * SourceDBInstanceIdentifier - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted
                     DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource
                     Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example,
                     if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the
                     us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier
                     looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115.


                  To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating
                  Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)

                  and Signature Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).


                  If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify
                  SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl
                  manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a
                  valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services
                  Region.


                  SourceRegion isn't supported for SQL Server, because Amazon RDS for SQL Server
                  doesn't support cross-Region read replicas.

                    Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.


                    To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the
                    Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore
                    feature name for the Name parameter.


                    You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance
                    when you call one of the following actions:


                       * CreateDBInstance


                       * ModifyDBInstance


                       * RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot


                       * RestoreDBInstanceFromS3


                       * RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime


                    You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by
                    calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the
                    instance class for the DBInstanceClass parameter.


                    In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor
                    information:


                       * DescribeDBInstances


                       * DescribeDBSnapshots


                       * DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications


                    If you call DescribeDBInstances, ProcessorFeature returns non-null values
                    only if the following conditions are met:


                       * You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                  A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.


                  When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS)
                  endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB instance's
                  virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside
                  of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled
                  by the security group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the
                  security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.


                  When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance
                  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.


                  Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnetGroupName
                  is specified.


                  If DBSubnetGroupName isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified,
                  the following applies:


                     * If the default VPC in the target Region doesnâ€™t have an internet gateway
                     attached to it, the DB instance is private.


                     * If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached
                     to it, the DB instance is public.


                  If DBSubnetGroupName is specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified,
                  the following applies:


                     * If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesnâ€™t have an internet gateway
                     attached to it, the DB instance is private.


                     * If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached
                     to it, the DB instance is public.

              replicaMode:
                description: |-
                  The open mode of the replica database: mounted or read-only.


                  This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.


                  Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The
                  main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The
                  primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to
                  the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted
                  replica can't serve a read-only workload.


                  You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the
                  same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with Oracle Read
                  Replicas for Amazon RDS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html)
                  in the Amazon RDS User Guide.


                  For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to mounted. The
                  value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the
                  open mode manually.

                  of Oracle and SQL Server, which can have up to five.


                  Constraints:


                     * Must be the identifier of an existing MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL,
                     or SQL Server DB instance.


                     * Can't be specified if the SourceDBClusterIdentifier parameter is also
                     specified.


                     * For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see Version and licensing

                     in the Amazon RDS User Guide.


                     * The specified DB instance must have automatic backups enabled, that
                     is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.


                     * If the source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Region
                     as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier.


                     * If the source DB instance is in a different Amazon Web Services Region
                     from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For more information,
                     see Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.ARN.html#USER_Tagging.ARN.Constructing)

                        Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.


                        To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the
                        Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore
                        feature name for the Name parameter.


                        You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance
                        when you call one of the following actions:


                           * CreateDBInstance


                           * ModifyDBInstance


                           * RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot


                           * RestoreDBInstanceFromS3


                           * RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime


                        You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by
                        calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the
                        instance class for the DBInstanceClass parameter.


                        In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor
                        information:


                           * DescribeDBInstances


                           * DescribeDBSnapshots


                           * DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications


                        If you call DescribeDBInstances, ProcessorFeature returns non-null values
                        only if the following conditions are met:


                           * You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.


                           * Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU
                           cores and threads per core.


                           * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.
