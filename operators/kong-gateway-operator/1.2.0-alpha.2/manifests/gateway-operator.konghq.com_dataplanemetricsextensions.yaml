          DataPlaneMetricsExtension holds the configuration for the DataPlane metrics extension.
          It can be attached to a ControlPlane using its spec.extensions.
          When attached it will make the ControlPlane configure its DataPlane with
          the specified metrics configuration.
          Additionally, it will also make the operator expose DataPlane's metrics
          enriched with metadata required for in-cluster Kubernetes autoscaling.


          NOTE: This is an enterprise feature. In order to use it you need to use
          the EE version of Kong Gateway Operator with a valid license.
