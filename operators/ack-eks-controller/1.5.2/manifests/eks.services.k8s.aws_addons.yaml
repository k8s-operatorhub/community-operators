                  How to resolve field value conflicts for an Amazon EKS add-on. Conflicts
                  are handled based on the value you choose:

                     * None – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your
                     cluster, Amazon EKS doesn't change the value. Creation of the add-on might
                     fail.

                     * Overwrite – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed
                     on your cluster and the Amazon EKS default value is different than the
                     existing value, Amazon EKS changes the value to the Amazon EKS default
                     value.

                     * Preserve – This is similar to the NONE option. If the self-managed
                     version of the add-on is installed on your cluster Amazon EKS doesn't
                     change the add-on resource properties. Creation of the add-on might fail
                     if conflicts are detected. This option works differently during the update
                     operation. For more information, see UpdateAddon (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAddon.html).

                  If you don't currently have the self-managed version of the add-on installed
                  on your cluster, the Amazon EKS add-on is installed. Amazon EKS sets all
                  values to default values, regardless of the option that you specify.

                description: |-
                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role to bind to the add-on's
                  service account. The role must be assigned the IAM permissions required by
                  the add-on. If you don't specify an existing IAM role, then the add-on uses
                  the permissions assigned to the node IAM role. For more information, see

                  in the Amazon EKS User Guide.

                  To specify an existing IAM role, you must have an IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC)
                  provider created for your cluster. For more information, see Enabling IAM
