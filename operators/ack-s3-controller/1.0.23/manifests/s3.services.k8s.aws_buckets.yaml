                           * General purpose buckets - If you're specifying a customer managed KMS
                           key, we recommend using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS
                           key alias instead, then KMS resolves the key within the requesterâ€™s
                           account. This behavior can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS
                           key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner.

                           * Directory buckets - When you specify an KMS customer managed key (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)
                           for encryption in your directory bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN.
                           The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.

                               at configuration, Amazon S3 automatically creates an Amazon Web Services
                               KMS key (aws/s3) in your Amazon Web Services account the first time that
                               you add an object encrypted with SSE-KMS to a bucket. By default, Amazon
                               S3 uses this KMS key for SSE-KMS.

                               * Directory buckets - Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer
                               managed key (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)

                                      Specifies the Amazon S3 object key name to filter on. An object key name
                                      is the name assigned to an object in your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify whether
                                      to filter on the suffix or prefix of the object key name. A prefix is a specific
                                      string of characters at the beginning of an object key name, which you can
                                      use to organize objects. For example, you can start the key names of related
                                      objects with a prefix, such as 2023- or engineering/. Then, you can use FilterRule
                                      to find objects in a bucket with key names that have the same prefix. A suffix
                                      is similar to a prefix, but it is at the end of the object key name instead
                                      of at the beginning.

                            BucketOwnerPreferred - Objects uploaded to the bucket change ownership to
                            the bucket owner if the objects are uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-control
                            canned ACL.

                            ObjectWriter - The uploading account will own the object if the object is
                            uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL.

                            BucketOwnerEnforced - Access control lists (ACLs) are disabled and no longer
                            affect permissions. The bucket owner automatically owns and has full control
                            over every object in the bucket. The bucket only accepts PUT requests that
                            don't specify an ACL or specify bucket owner full control ACLs (such as the
                            predefined bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL or a custom ACL in XML format
                            that grants the same permissions).

                            By default, ObjectOwnership is set to BucketOwnerEnforced and ACLs are disabled.
                            We recommend keeping ACLs disabled, except in uncommon use cases where you
                            must control access for each object individually. For more information about

                            A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication rule
                            applies. A Filter must specify exactly one Prefix, Tag, or an And child element.

                                A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the subset
                                of objects to which the rule applies. This element is required only if you
                                specify more than one filter.

                                For example:

                                   * If you specify both a Prefix and a Tag filter, wrap these filters in
                                   an And tag.

                                   * If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the Tag elements
                                   in an And tag.

                                specify this element and set the status to Enabled to replicate modifications
                                on replicas.

                                If you don't specify the Filter element, Amazon S3 assumes that the replication
                                configuration is the earlier version, V1. In the earlier version, this element
                                is not allowed.
