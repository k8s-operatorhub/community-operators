    # Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes The Splunk
    Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk
    Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator
    simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating
    administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices.
    The Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator
    pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
    and [custom
    resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
    objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise
    environment.
    This guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the Splunk
    Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:
    * [Known Issues for the Splunk
    Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator) * [Prerequisites for the
    Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator) * [Installing the
    Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator) * [Creating Splunk
    Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment) *
    [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md) * [Contacting
    Support](#contacting-support)
    ## Support Resources

    ## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator
    Review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each
    release.
    ## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator
    ### Supported Kubernetes Versions
    - Kubernetes, version 1.21.0+ and later (x86 64-bit only).
    The Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified
    distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of
    Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of
    platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used
    successfully with the Splunk Operator.
    <table> <tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon
    Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>
    <tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes
    Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr> <tr><td> Partner Tested
    Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr> <tr><td> Other Platforms
    </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr> </table>
    ### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility Each Splunk Operator release has
    specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or
    upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to
    verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.
    ### Splunk Apps Installation
    Apps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the
    instructions given at [Installing Splunk
    Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise
    Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.
    ### Docker requirements The Splunk Operator requires these docker images to
    be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:
    * `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this
    repository or the [official
    release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.1.1 or later) *
    `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise
    image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.2 or later)
    All of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker
    Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull
    from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.
    Review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and
    Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.
    ### Hardware Resources Requirements The resource guidelines for running
    production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator
    are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating
    system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware
    documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware)
    for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance
    on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages
    (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP)
    for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may
    impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.
    #### Minimum Reference Hardware Based on Splunk Enterprise [Reference
    Hardware
    documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware),
    a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.
    | Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |
    | ---------- | ------- | ------- | | _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU
    Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head
    Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB
    RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or
    greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |
    #### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_
    In addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware,
    [Kubernetes Quality of Service
    Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)
    can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your
    _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes
    Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:
    | QoS        | Summary| Description | | ---------- | ------- | ------- | |
    _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When
    the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the
    pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended
    for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ | | _Burstable_ |
    _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory
    ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a
    QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance
    testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources,
    and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._| |
    _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When
    the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a
    QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing,
    or a small development task___._ |
    Examples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed
    and Burstable
    QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.
    ### Storage guidelines The Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent
    Volume
    Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims)
    to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration ("$SPLUNK_HOME/etc"
    path) and event ("$SPLUNK_HOME/var" path) data. If one of the underlying
    machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting
    the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same
    data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team
    by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a
    service restart.  The use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your
    cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage
    Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See
    the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for
    more information.
    ### What Storage Type To Use?
    The Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or
    exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type
    recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to
    use for a given
    role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F)
    In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the
    necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.
    ### Splunk SmartStore Required For production environments, we are requiring
    the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data
    volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute
    resources. [Splunk's SmartStore
    Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore)
    allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a
    ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately.
    SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent
    data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object
    store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for
    configuring and using SmartStore through operator.
    ## Installing the Splunk Operator
    A Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator
    for specific namespace by running: ``` kubectl apply -f
    https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.1.1/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml
    ```
    A Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator
    for cluster-wide by running: ``` kubectl apply -f
    https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.1.1/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml
    ```
    The [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance
    for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries,
    installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user
    who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should
    review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.
    The [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance
    for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries,
    installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user
    who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should
    review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.
    *Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a
    private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating
    large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images
    Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation
    Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the
    Docker images.*
    After the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within
    your current namespace: ``` $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    splunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s ```
    ### Installation using Helm charts
    Installing the Splunk Operator using Helm allows you to quickly deploy the
    operator and Splunk Enterprise in a Kubernetes cluster. The operator and
    custom resources are easily configurable allowing for advanced installations
    including support for Splunk Validated Architectures. Helm also provides a
    number of features to manage the operator and custom resource lifecycle. The
    [Installation using Helm](Helm.md) page will walk you through installing and
    configuring Splunk Enterprise deployments using Helm charts.
    ## Upgrading the Splunk Operator
    For information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade
    Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md)
    page.
    ## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment
    The `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance
    deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:
    1. Run the command to create a deployment named “s1”:
    ```yaml cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f - apiVersion:
    enterprise.splunk.com/v4 kind: Standalone metadata: name: s1 finalizers: -
    enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc EOF ```
    **The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells
    the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent
    Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
    associated with the instance if you delete the custom resource(CR).**
    Within a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:
    ``` $ kubectl get pods NAME                                   READY
    STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE splunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1
    Running   0          11h splunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1
    Running   0          45s ```
    *Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy
    the output.*
    2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk
    Web access:
    ``` kubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000 ```
    3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords
    used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and
    read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret
    object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.
    4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin`
    account with the password.
    5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:
    ``` kubectl delete standalone s1 ```
    The `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk
    Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters
    they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.
    For additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters,
