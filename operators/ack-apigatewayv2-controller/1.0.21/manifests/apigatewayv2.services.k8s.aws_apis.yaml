                  Amazon Resource Name (ARN). To require that the caller's identity be passed
                  through from the request, specify arn:aws:iam::*:user/*. To use resource-based

                  This property is part of quick create. If you don't specify a routeKey, a
                  default route of $default is created. The $default route acts as a catch-all
                  for any request made to your API, for a particular stage. The $default route
                  key can't be modified. You can add routes after creating the API, and you
                  can update the route keys of additional routes. Supported only for HTTP APIs.
