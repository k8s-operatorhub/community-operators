                  The service principal for the Amazon Web Services service to which this role

                  front. For example: elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com.

                  Service principals are unique and case-sensitive. To find the exact service
                  principal for your service-linked role, see Amazon Web Services services
                  that work with IAM (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html)
                  in the IAM User Guide. Look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked
                  Role column. Choose the Yes link to view the service-linked role documentation
                  for that service.

                  service, then you must supply a different CustomSuffix for each request.
                  Otherwise the request fails with a duplicate role name error. For example,
                  you could add -1 or -debug to the suffix.

                  Some services do not support the CustomSuffix parameter. If you provide an
                  optional suffix and the operation fails, try the operation again without
                  the suffix.
