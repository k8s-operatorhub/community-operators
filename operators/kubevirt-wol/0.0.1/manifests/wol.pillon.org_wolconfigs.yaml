                              Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                              This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                              Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                              Default value is 0.
                              Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                              that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                              can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                              The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                              pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                              on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                              reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                              pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                              Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                              daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                              so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                              cause evictions during disruption.

                              number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute
                              number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
                              This cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0

                              can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                              starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                              up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,

                              the update.

                        A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                        relates the key and values.

                            operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.
                            Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

                            values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
                            the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
                            the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                            merge patch.
